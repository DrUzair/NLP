# **t-SNE Visualization for Text Data: A Comprehensive Tutorial**

**Uzair Ahmad**

### Introduction:

Text data, with its high dimensionality, poses challenges in visualization. t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) is a powerful technique for visualizing high-dimensional data in lower dimensions, making it an ideal tool for exploring and understanding the structure of text datasets. In this tutorial, we will delve into the basics of t-SNE and guide you through its implementation using Python.

### Prerequisites:

Before diving into the tutorial, ensure you have the following libraries installed:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

### Understanding t-SNE

**1.1 What is t-SNE?**
   - t-SNE is a dimensionality reduction technique that focuses on preserving pairwise similarities between data points in a lower-dimensional space. It is particularly effective in revealing the underlying structure of complex datasets.

**1.2 Why Use t-SNE for Text Data?**
   - Text data often involves high-dimensional feature spaces. t-SNE helps visualize relationships between documents, uncover latent patterns, and highlight clusters within the data.

### Implementing t-SNE in Python

**Loading the Data:**

   - For this tutorial, we'll use a sample text dataset. You can replace it with your own dataset.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load your text dataset
df = pd.read_csv('your_text_data.csv')
```

**Text Vectorization:**

   - Convert text data into numerical vectors using TF-IDF or other text representation techniques.

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer

vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(stop_words='english')
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(df['Text'])
```

**Applying t-SNE:**

   - Use scikit-learn to apply t-SNE and reduce dimensionality to 2D.

```python
from sklearn.manifold import TSNE

tsne = TSNE(n_components=2, random_state=42)
tsne_results = tsne.fit_transform(X)
```

**Visualizing Results:**

   - Create a scatter plot to visualize the t-SNE results.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
sns.scatterplot(x=tsne_results[:, 0], y=tsne_results[:, 1], hue=df['Label'], palette='viridis', alpha=0.7)
plt.title('t-SNE Visualization of Text Data')
plt.xlabel('t-SNE Dimension 1')
plt.ylabel('t-SNE Dimension 2')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

### Interpretation and Analysis

**Understanding Clusters:**

   - Observe clusters formed by t-SNE. Each point represents a document, and clusters may indicate similarity or thematic groupings.

**Examining Outliers:**

   - Identify isolated points or outliers, as they may represent unique or anomalous documents in the dataset.

**Adjusting Parameters:**

   - Experiment with t-SNE parameters (e.g., perplexity, learning rate) to observe their impact on the visualization.

In this tutorial, you learned how to leverage t-SNE for visualizing text data. This technique allows you to uncover patterns, explore clusters, and gain insights into the structure of your text dataset. Experiment with different datasets and parameters to enhance your understanding of the data's underlying relationships.

## Hands on Example

The t-SNE plot provides a visual representation of the similarity relationships between text documents, with clusters indicating groups of similar documents. The interpretation may involve looking for patterns, assessing separation between clusters, and gaining insights into the underlying structure of the dataset. The following example visualizes Ham and Spam email in 2-D scatterplot using t-SNE.

```python
import requests
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.manifold import TSNE
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# URL of the hamspam file
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DrUzair/NLP/master/data/SMSSpamCollection"

# Download the file content
response = requests.get(url)
lines = response.text.split('\n')

# Extract labels and text
labels = [line.split()[0] for line in lines if len(line.split()) > 0]
text = [' '.join(line.split()[1:]) for line in lines if len(line.split()) > 0]

# Create a DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame({'Label': labels, 'Text': text})

# Use TF-IDF to convert text data into numerical vectors
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(stop_words='english')
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(df['Text'])

# Apply t-SNE for visualization with "random" initialization
tsne = TSNE(n_components=2, random_state=42, init="random")
tsne_results = tsne.fit_transform(X)

# Add t-SNE results to DataFrame
df['tsne_1'] = tsne_results[:, 0]
df['tsne_2'] = tsne_results[:, 1]

# Plot the t-SNE visualization
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
sns.scatterplot(x='tsne_1', y='tsne_2', hue='Label', data=df, palette='viridis', alpha=0.7)
plt.title('t-SNE Visualization of Ham/Spam Text')
plt.show()

```

The t-SNE plot is a two-dimensional representation of the high-dimensional data points, where each point corresponds to a text document. The colors in the plot represent the labels ("ham" or "spam"). Here's how you can interpret the output:

1. **Scatter Plot:**
   - Each point on the plot represents a text document.
   - The position of the points is determined by the t-SNE algorithm, which aims to group similar documents together.

2. **Colors:**
   - Points are colored based on their labels ("ham" or "spam").
   - Documents with the same label tend to cluster together if they are similar in the high-dimensional space.

3. **Clusters:**
   - Look for clusters of points with the same color. These clusters suggest that documents within the same cluster are similar to each other.

4. **Separation:**
   - The degree of separation between clusters indicates the dissimilarity between different classes. If clusters are well-separated, it suggests that the t-SNE algorithm has successfully captured the underlying structure of the data.

5. **Patterns:**
   - Observe any patterns or shapes in the plot. These patterns may reveal interesting structures or relationships between the documents.

Keep in mind that t-SNE is a stochastic algorithm, meaning that it can produce different results on different runs. Therefore, while the general patterns and clusters are informative, the specific arrangement of points may vary between runs.

## Challenge

Improve the visualization by making it interactive such that user can see the email content when a data point in the plot is clicked.
