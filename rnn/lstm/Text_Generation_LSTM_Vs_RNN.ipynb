              "'BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.: \\r\\n\\r\\nOur gain in net worth during 2006 was $16.9 billion, which increased the per-share book value of \\r\\nboth our Class A and Class B stock by 18.4%. Over the last 42 years (that is, since present management \\r\\ntook over) book value has grown from $19 to $70,281, a rate of 21.4% compounded annually.* \\r\\n\\r\\nWe believe that $16.9 billion is a record for a one-year gain in net worth - more than has ever \\r\\nbeen booked by any American business, leaving aside boosts that have occurred because of mergers (e.g., \\r\\nAOL\\'s purchase of Time Warner). Of course, Exxon Mobil and other companies earn far more than \\r\\nBerkshire, but their earnings largely go to dividends and/or repurchases, rather than to building net worth. \\r\\n\\r\\nAll that said, a confession about our 2006 gain is in order. Our most important business, \\r\\ninsurance, benefited from a large dose of luck: Mother Nature, bless her heart, went on vacation. After \\r\\nhammering us with hurricanes in 2004 and 2005 - storms that caused us to lose a bundle on super-cat \\r\\ninsurance - she just vanished. Last year, the red ink from this activity turned black - very black. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition, the great majority of our 73 businesses did outstandingly well in 2006. Let me focus \\r\\nfor a moment on one of our largest operations, GEICO. What management accomplished there was simply \\r\\nextraordinary. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs I\\'ve told you before, Tony Nicely, GEICO\\' s CEO, went to work at the company 45 years ago, \\r\\ntwo months after turning 18. He became CEO in 1992, and from then on the company\\'s growth exploded. \\r\\nIn addition, Tony has delivered staggering productivity gains in recent years. Between yearend 2003 and \\r\\nyearend 2006, the number of GEICO policies increased from 5.7 million to 8.1 million, a jump of 42%. \\r\\nYet during that same period, the company\\'s employees (measured on a fulltime-equivalent basis) fell 3.5%. \\r\\nSo productivity grew 47%. And GEICO didn\\'t start fat. \\r\\n\\r\\nThat remarkable gain has allowed GEICO to maintain its all-important position as a low-cost \\r\\nproducer, even though it has dramatically increased advertising expenditures. Last year GEICO spent $631 \\r\\nmillion on ads, up from $238 million in 2003 (and up from $31 million in 1995, when Berkshire took \\r\\ncontrol). Today, GEICO spends far more on ads than any of its competitors, even those much larger. We \\r\\nwill continue to raise the bar. \\r\\n\\r\\nLast year I told you that if you had a new son or grandson to be sure to name him Tony. But Don \\r\\nKeough, a Berkshire director, recently had a better idea. After reviewing GEICO\\'s performance in 2006, \\r\\nhe wrote me, \"Forget births. Tell the shareholders to immediately change the names of their present \\r\\nchildren to Tony or Antoinette.\" Don signed his letter \"Tony.\" \\r\\n\\r\\nCharlie Munger - my partner and Berkshire\\'s vice chairman - and I run what has turned out to be \\r\\na big business, one with 217,000 employees and annual revenues approaching $100 billion. We certainly \\r\\ndidn\\'t plan it that way. Charlie began as a lawyer, and I thought of myself as a security analyst. Sitting in \\r\\nthose seats, we both grew skeptical about the ability of big entities of any type to function well. Size seems \\r\\nto make many organizations slow-thinking, resistant to change and smug. In Churchill\\'s words: \"We shape \\r\\nour buildings, and afterwards our buildings shape us.\" Here\\'s a telling fact: Of the ten non-oil companies \\r\\nhaving the largest market capitalization in 1965 - titans such as General Motors, Sears, DuPont and \\r\\nEastman Kodak - only one made the 2006 list. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*A11 per-share figures used in this report apply to Berkshire\\'s A shares. Figures for the B shares \\r\\nare 1/30* of those shown for the A. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n3 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn fairness, we\\'ve seen plenty of successes as well, some truly outstanding. There are many giant- \\r\\ncompany managers whom I greatly admire; Ken Chenault of American Express, Jeff Immelt of G.E. and \\r\\nDick Kovacevich of Wells Fargo come quickly to mind. But I don\\'t think I could do the management job \\r\\nthey do. And I know I wouldn\\'t enjoy many of the duties that come with their positions - meetings, \\r\\nspeeches, foreign travel, the charity circuit and governmental relations. For me, Ronald Reagan had it \\r\\nright: \"It\\'s probably true that hard work never killed anyone - but why take the chance?\" \\r\\n\\r\\nSo I\\'ve taken the easy route, just sitting back and working through great managers who run their \\r\\nown shows. My only tasks are to cheer them on, sculpt and harden our corporate culture, and make major \\r\\ncapital-allocation decisions. Our managers have returned this trust by working hard and effectively. \\r\\n\\r\\nFor their performance over the last 42 years - and particularly for 2006 - Charlie and I thank \\r\\n\\r\\nthem. \\r\\n\\r\\nYardsticks \\r\\n\\r\\nCharlie and I measure Berkshire\\'s progress and evaluate its intrinsic value in a number of ways. \\r\\nNo single criterion is effective in doing these jobs, and even an avalanche of statistics will not capture some \\r\\nfactors that are important. For example, it\\'s essential that we have managers much younger than I available \\r\\nto succeed me. Berkshire has never been in better shape in this regard - but I can\\'t prove it to you with \\r\\nnumbers. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere are two statistics, however, that are of real importance. The first is the amount of \\r\\ninvestments (including cash and cash-equivalents) that we own on a per-share basis. Arriving at this figure, \\r\\nwe exclude investments held in our finance operation because these are largely offset by borrowings. \\r\\nHere\\'s the record since present management acquired control of Berkshire: \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nYear Per-Share Investments * \\r\\n\\r\\n1965 $ 4 \\r\\n\\r\\n1975 159 \\r\\n\\r\\n1985 2,407 \\r\\n\\r\\n1995 21,817 \\r\\n\\r\\n2006 $80,636 \\r\\n\\r\\nCompound Growth Rate 1965-2006 27.5% \\r\\n\\r\\nCompound Growth Rate 1995-2006 12.6% \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*Net of minority interests \\r\\n\\r\\nIn our early years we put most of our retained earnings and insurance float into investments in \\r\\nmarketable securities. Because of this emphasis, and because the securities we purchased generally did \\r\\nwell, our growth rate in investments was for a long time quite high. \\r\\n\\r\\nOver the years, however, we have focused more and more on the acquisition of operating \\r\\nbusinesses. Using our funds for these purchases has both slowed our growth in investments and accelerated \\r\\nour gains in pre-tax earnings from non-insurance businesses, the second yardstick we use. Here\\'s how \\r\\nthose earnings have looked: \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n4 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nYear \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPre-Tax Earnings Per Share * \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n1965 $ 4 \\r\\n\\r\\n1975 4 \\r\\n\\r\\n1985 52 \\r\\n\\r\\n1995 175 \\r\\n\\r\\n2006 $3,625 \\r\\n\\r\\nCompound Growth Rate 1965-2006 17.9% \\r\\n\\r\\nCompound Growth Rate 1995-2006 31.7% \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*Excluding purchase-accounting adjustments and net of minority interests \\r\\n\\r\\nLast year we had a good increase in non-insurance earnings - 38%. Large gains from here on in, \\r\\nthough, will come only if we are able to make major, and sensible, acquisitions. That will not be easy. We \\r\\ndo, however, have one advantage: More and more, Berkshire has become \"the buyer of choice\" for \\r\\nbusiness owners and managers. Initially, we were viewed that way only in the U.S. (and more often than \\r\\nnot by private companies). We\\'ve long wanted, nonetheless, to extend Berkshire\\'s appeal beyond U.S. \\r\\nborders. And last year, our globe-trotting finally got underway. \\r\\n\\r\\nAcquisitions \\r\\n\\r\\nWe began 2006 by completing the three acquisitions pending at yearend 2005, spending about $6 \\r\\nbillion for PacifiCorp, Business Wire and Applied Underwriters. All are performing very well. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe highlight of the year, however, was our July 5 th acquisition of most of ISCAR, an Israeli \\r\\ncompany, and our new association with its chairman, Eitan Wertheimer, and CEO, Jacob Harpaz. The \\r\\nstory here began on October 25, 2005, when I received a 114-page letter from Eitan, of whom I then knew \\r\\nnothing. The letter began, \"I am writing to introduce you to ISCAR,\" and proceeded to describe a cutting- \\r\\ntool business carried on in 61 countries. Then Eitan wrote, \"We have for some time considered the issues \\r\\nof generational transfer and ownership that are typical for large family enterprises, and have given much \\r\\nthought to ISCAR\\' s future. Our conclusion is that Berkshire Hathaway would be the ideal home for \\r\\nISCAR. We believe that ISCAR would continue to thrive as a part of your portfolio of businesses.\" \\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, Eitan\\' s letter made the quality of the company and the character of its management leap \\r\\noff the page. It also made me want to learn more, and in November, Eitan, Jacob and ISCAR\\' s CFO, \\r\\nDanny Goldman, came to Omaha. A few hours with them convinced me that if we were to make a deal, we \\r\\nwould be teaming up with extraordinarily talented managers who could be trusted to run the business after \\r\\na sale with all of the energy and dedication that they had exhibited previously. However, having never \\r\\nbought a business based outside of the U.S. (though I had bought a number of foreign stocks), I needed to \\r\\nget educated on some tax and jurisdictional matters. With that task completed, Berkshire purchased 80% of \\r\\nISCAR for $4 billion. The remaining 20% stays in the hands of the Wertheimer family, making it our \\r\\nvalued partner. \\r\\n\\r\\nISCAR\\' s products are small, consumable cutting tools that are used in conjunction with large and \\r\\nexpensive machine tools. It\\'s a business without magic except for that imparted by the people who run it. \\r\\nBut Eitan, Jacob and their associates are true managerial magicians who constantly develop tools that make \\r\\ntheir customers\\' machines more productive. The result: ISCAR makes money because it enables its \\r\\ncustomers to make more money. There is no better recipe for continued success. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n5 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn September, Charlie and I, along with five Berkshire associates, visited ISCAR in Israel. We - \\r\\nand I mean every one of us - have never been more impressed with any operation. At ISCAR, as \\r\\nthroughout Israel, brains and energy are ubiquitous. Berkshire shareholders are lucky to have joined with \\r\\nEitan, Jacob, Danny and their talented associates. \\r\\n\\r\\nA few months later, Berkshire again became \"the buyer of choice\" in a deal brought to us by my \\r\\nfriend, John Roach, of Fort Worth. John, many of you will remember, was Chairman of Justin Industries, \\r\\nwhich we bought in 2000. At that time John was helping John Justin, who was terminally ill, find a \\r\\npermanent home for his company. John Justin died soon after we bought Justin Industries, but it has since \\r\\nbeen run exactly as we promised him it would be. \\r\\n\\r\\nVisiting me in November, John Roach brought along Paul Andrews, Jr., owner of about 80% of \\r\\nTTI, a Fort Worth distributor of electronic components. Over a 35-year period, Paul built TTI from \\r\\n$112,000 of sales to $1.3 billion. He is a remarkable entrepreneur and operator. \\r\\n\\r\\nPaul, 64, loves running his business. But not long ago he happened to witness how disruptive the \\r\\ndeath of a founder can be both to a private company\\'s employees and the owner\\'s family. What starts out \\r\\nas disruptive, furthermore, often evolves into destructive. About a year ago, therefore, Paul began to think \\r\\nabout selling TTI. His goal was to put his business in the hands of an owner he had carefully chosen, rather \\r\\nthan allowing a trust officer or lawyer to conduct an auction after his death. \\r\\n\\r\\nPaul rejected the idea of a \"strategic\" buyer, knowing that in the pursuit of \"synergies,\" an owner \\r\\nof that type would be apt to dismantle what he had so carefully built, a move that would uproot hundreds of \\r\\nhis associates (and perhaps wound TTI\\'s business in the process). He also ruled out a private equity firm, \\r\\nwhich would very likely load the company with debt and then flip it as soon as possible. \\r\\n\\r\\nThat left Berkshire. Paul and I met on the morning of November 15 th and made a deal before \\r\\nlunch. Later he wrote me: \"After our meeting, I am confident that Berkshire is the right owner for TTI . . . \\r\\nI am proud of our past and excited about our future.\" And so are Charlie and I. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe also made some \"tuck-in\" acquisitions during 2006 at Fruit of the Loom (\"Fruit\"), MiTek, \\r\\nCTB, Shaw and Clayton. Fruit made the largest purchases. First, it bought Russell Corp., a leading \\r\\nproducer of athletic apparel and uniforms for about $1.2 billion (including assumed debt) and in December \\r\\nit agreed to buy the intimate apparel business of VF Corp. Together, these acquisitions add about $2.2 \\r\\nbillion to Fruit\\'s sales and bring with them about 23,000 employees. \\r\\n\\r\\nCharlie and I love it when we can acquire businesses that can be placed under managers, such as \\r\\nJohn Holland at Fruit, who have already shown their stuff at Berkshire. MiTek, for example, has made 14 \\r\\nacquisitions since we purchased it in 2001, and Gene Toombs has delivered results from these deals far in \\r\\nexcess of what he had predicted. In effect, we leverage the managerial talent already with us by these tuck- \\r\\nin deals. We will make many more. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe continue, however, to need \"elephants\" in order for us to use Berkshire\\'s flood of incoming \\r\\ncash. Charlie and I must therefore ignore the pursuit of mice and focus our acquisition efforts on much \\r\\nbigger game. \\r\\n\\r\\nOur exemplar is the older man who crashed his grocery cart into that of a much younger fellow \\r\\nwhile both were shopping. The elderly man explained apologetically that he had lost track of his wife and \\r\\nwas preoccupied searching for her. His new acquaintance said that by coincidence his wife had also \\r\\nwandered off and suggested that it might be more efficient if they jointly looked for the two women. \\r\\nAgreeing, the older man asked his new companion what his wife looked like. \"She\\'s a gorgeous blonde,\" \\r\\nthe fellow answered, \"with a body that would cause a bishop to go through a stained glass window, and \\r\\nshe\\'s wearing tight white shorts. How about yours?\" The senior citizen wasted no words: \"Forget her, \\r\\nwe\\'ll look for yours.\" \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n6 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat we are looking for is described on page 25. If you have an acquisition candidate that fits, \\r\\ncall me - day or night. And then watch me shatter a stained glass window. \\r\\n\\r\\nNow, let\\'s examine the four major operating sectors of Berkshire. Lumping their financial figures \\r\\ntogether impedes analysis. So we\\'ll look at them as four separate businesses, starting with the all- \\r\\nimportant insurance group. \\r\\n\\r\\nInsurance \\r\\n\\r\\nNext month marks the 40 th anniversary of our entrance into the insurance business. It was on \\r\\nMarch 9, 1967, that Berkshire purchased National Indemnity and its companion company, National Fire & \\r\\nMarine, from Jack Ringwalt for $8.6 million. \\r\\n\\r\\nJack was a long-time friend of mine and an excellent, but somewhat eccentric, businessman. For \\r\\nabout ten minutes every year he would get the urge to sell his company. But those moods - perhaps \\r\\nbrought on by a tiff with regulators or an unfavorable jury verdict - quickly vanished. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the mid-1960s, I asked investment banker Charlie Heider, a mutual friend of mine and Jack\\'s, \\r\\nto alert me the next time Jack was \"in heat.\" When Charlie\\'s call came, I sped to meet Jack. We made a \\r\\ndeal in a few minutes, with me waiving an audit, \"due diligence\" or anything else that would give Jack an \\r\\nopportunity to reconsider. We just shook hands, and that was that. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen we were due to close the purchase at Charlie\\'s office, Jack was late. Finally arriving, he \\r\\nexplained that he had been driving around looking for a parking meter with some unexpired time. That was \\r\\na magic moment for me. I knew then that Jack was going to be my kind of manager. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Berkshire purchased Jack\\'s two insurers, they had \"float\" of $17 million. We\\'ve regularly \\r\\noffered a long explanation of float in earlier reports, which you can read on our website. Simply put, float \\r\\nis money we hold that is not ours but which we get to invest. \\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of 2006, our float had grown to $50.9 billion, and we have since written a huge \\r\\nretroactive reinsurance contract with Equitas - which I will describe in the next section - that boosts float \\r\\nby another $7 billion. Much of the gain we\\'ve made has come through our acquisition of other insurers, \\r\\nbut we\\'ve also had outstanding internal growth, particularly at Ajit Jain\\'s amazing reinsurance operation. \\r\\nNaturally, I had no notion in 1967 that our float would develop as it has. There\\'s much to be said for just \\r\\nputting one foot in front of the other every day. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe float from retroactive reinsurance contracts, of which we have many, automatically drifts \\r\\ndown over time. Therefore, it will be difficult for us to increase float in the future unless we make new \\r\\nacquisitions in the insurance field. Whatever its size, however, the all-important cost of Berkshire\\'s float \\r\\nover time is likely to be significantly below that of the industry, perhaps even falling to less than zero. \\r\\nNote the words \"over time.\" There will be bad years periodically. You can be sure of that. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2006, though, everything went right in insurance - really right. Our managers - Tony Nicely \\r\\n(GEICO), Ajit Jain (B-H Reinsurance), Joe Brandon and Tad Montross (General Re), Don Wurster \\r\\n(National Indemnity Primary), Tom Nerney (U.S. Liability), Tim Kenesey (Medical Protective), Rod \\r\\nEldred (Homestate Companies and Cypress), Sid Ferenc and Steve Menzies (Applied Underwriters), John \\r\\nKizer (Central States) and Don Towle (Kansas Bankers Surety) - simply shot the lights out. When I recite \\r\\ntheir names, I feel as if I\\'m at Cooperstown, reading from the Hall of Fame roster. Of course, the overall \\r\\ninsurance industry also had a terrific year in 2006. But our managers delivered results generally superior to \\r\\nthose of their competitors. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n7 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBelow is the tally on our underwriting and float for each major sector of insurance. Enjoy the \\r\\nview, because you won\\'t soon see another like it. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n(in $ millions) \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nUnderwriting Profit (Loss) \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nYearend Float \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nInsurance Operations 2006 2005 \\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral Re $ 526 $( 334) \\r\\n\\r\\nB-H Reinsurance 1,658 (1,069) \\r\\n\\r\\nGEICO 1,314 1,221 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther Primary 340 ** 235 * \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal $3.838 $ 53 \\r\\n\\r\\n* Includes MedPro from June 30, 2005. \\r\\n** Includes Applied Underwriters from May 19, 2006. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n$22,827 $22,920 \\r\\n\\r\\n16,860 16,233 \\r\\n\\r\\n7,171 6,692 \\r\\n\\r\\n4,029 3,442 \\r\\n\\r\\n$50.887 $49.287 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n2006 2005 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2007, our results from the bread-and-butter lines of insurance will deteriorate, though I think \\r\\nthey will remain satisfactory. The big unknown is super-cat insurance. Were the terrible hurricane seasons \\r\\nof 2004-05 aberrations? Or were they our planet\\'s first warning that the climate of the 21 st Century will \\r\\ndiffer materially from what we\\'ve seen in the past? If the answer to the second question is yes, 2006 will \\r\\nsoon be perceived as a misleading period of calm preceding a series of devastating storms. These could \\r\\nrock the insurance industry. It\\'s naive to think of Katrina as anything close to a worst-case event. \\r\\n\\r\\nNeither Ajit Jain, who manages our super-cat operation, nor I know what lies ahead. We do know \\r\\nthat it would be a huge mistake to bet that evolving atmospheric changes are benign in their implications \\r\\nfor insurers. \\r\\n\\r\\nDon\\'t think, however, that we have lost our taste for risk. We remain prepared to lose $6 billion \\r\\nin a single event, ifwe have been paid appropriately for assuming that risk. We are not willing, though, to \\r\\ntake on even very small exposures at prices that don\\'t reflect our evaluation of loss probabilities. \\r\\nAppropriate prices don\\'t guarantee profits in any given year, but inappropriate prices most certainly \\r\\nguarantee eventual losses. Rates have recently fallen because a flood of capital has entered the super-cat \\r\\nfield. We have therefore sharply reduced our wind exposures. Our behavior here parallels that which we \\r\\nemploy in financial markets: Be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful. \\r\\n\\r\\nLloyd\\'s, Equitas and Retroactive Reinsurance \\r\\n\\r\\nLast year - we are getting now to Equitas - Berkshire agreed to enter into a huge retroactive \\r\\nreinsurance contract, a policy that protects an insurer against losses that have already happened, but whose \\r\\ncost is not yet known. I\\'ll give you details of the agreement shortly. But let\\'s first take a journey through \\r\\ninsurance history, following the route that led to our deal. \\r\\n\\r\\nOur tale begins around 1688, when Edward Lloyd opened a small coffee house in London. \\r\\nThough no Starbucks, his shop was destined to achieve worldwide fame because of the commercial \\r\\nactivities of its clientele - shipowners, merchants and venturesome British capitalists. As these parties \\r\\nsipped Edward\\'s brew, they began to write contracts transferring the risk of a disaster at sea from the \\r\\nowners of ships and their cargo to the capitalists, who wagered that a given voyage would be completed \\r\\nwithout incident. These capitalists eventually became known as \"underwriters at Lloyd\\'s.\" \\r\\n\\r\\nThough many people believe Lloyd\\'s to be an insurance company, that is not the case. It is \\r\\ninstead a place where many member-insurers transact business, just as they did centuries ago. \\r\\n\\r\\nOver time, the underwriters solicited passive investors to join in syndicates. Additionally, the \\r\\nbusiness broadened beyond marine risks into every imaginable form of insurance, including exotic \\r\\ncoverages that spread the fame of Lloyd\\'s far and wide. The underwriters left the coffee house, found \\r\\ngrander quarters and formalized some rules of association. And those persons who passively backed the \\r\\nunderwriters became known as \"names.\" \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n8 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEventually, the names came to include many thousands of people from around the world, who \\r\\njoined expecting to pick up some extra change without effort or serious risk. True, prospective names were \\r\\nalways solemnly told that they would have unlimited and everlasting liability for the consequences of their \\r\\nsyndicate\\'s underwriting - \"down to the last cufflink,\" as the quaint description went. But that warning \\r\\ncame to be viewed as perfunctory. Three hundred years of retained cufflinks acted as a powerful sedative \\r\\nto the names poised to sign up. \\r\\n\\r\\nThen came asbestos. When its prospective costs were added to the tidal wave of environmental \\r\\nand product claims that surfaced in the 1980s, Lloyd\\'s began to implode. Policies written decades earlier - \\r\\nand largely forgotten about - were developing huge losses. No one could intelligently estimate their total, \\r\\nbut it was certain to be many tens of billions of dollars. The specter of unending and unlimited losses \\r\\nterrified existing names and scared away prospects. Many names opted for bankruptcy; some even chose \\r\\nsuicide. \\r\\n\\r\\nFrom these shambles, there came a desperate effort to resuscitate Lloyd\\'s. In 1996, the powers \\r\\nthat be at the institution allotted £11.1 billion to a new company, Equitas, and made it responsible for \\r\\npaying all claims on policies written before 1993. In effect, this plan pooled the misery of the many \\r\\nsyndicates in trouble. Of course, the money allotted could prove to be insufficient - and if that happened, \\r\\nthe names remained liable for the shortfall. \\r\\n\\r\\nBut the new plan, by concentrating all of the liabilities in one place, had the advantage of \\r\\neliminating much of the costly intramural squabbling that went on among syndicates. Moreover, the \\r\\npooling allowed claims evaluation, negotiation and litigation to be handled more intelligently than had been \\r\\nthe case previously. Equitas embraced Ben Franklin\\'s thinking: \"We must all hang together, or assuredly \\r\\nwe shall hang separately.\" \\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the start, many people predicted Equitas would eventually fail. But as Ajit and I reviewed \\r\\nthe facts in the spring of 2006 - 13 years after the last exposed policy had been written and after the \\r\\npayment of £11.3 billion in claims - we concluded that the patient was likely to survive. And so we \\r\\ndecided to offer a huge reinsurance policy to Equitas. \\r\\n\\r\\nBecause plenty of imponderables continue to exist, Berkshire could not provide Equitas, and its \\r\\n27,972 names, unlimited protection. But we said - and I\\'m simplifying - that if Equitas would give us \\r\\n$7.12 billion in cash and securities (this is the float I spoke about), we would pay all of its future claims and \\r\\nexpenses up to $13.9 billion. That amount was $5.7 billion above what Equitas had recently guessed its \\r\\nultimate liabilities to be. Thus the names received a huge - and almost certainly sufficient - amount of \\r\\nfuture protection against unpleasant surprises. Indeed the protection is so large that Equitas plans a cash \\r\\npayment to its thousands of names, an event few of them had ever dreamed possible. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd how will Berkshire fare? That depends on how much \"known\" claims will end up costing us, \\r\\nhow many yet-to-be-presented claims will surface and what they will cost, how soon claim payments will \\r\\nbe made and how much we earn on the cash we receive before it must be paid out. Ajit and I think the odds \\r\\nare in our favor. And should we be wrong, Berkshire can handle it. \\r\\n\\r\\nScott Moser, the CEO of Equitas, summarized the transaction neatly: \"Names wanted to sleep \\r\\neasy at night, and we think we\\'ve just bought them the world\\'s best mattress.\" \\r\\n\\r\\nWarning: It\\'s time to eat your broccoli - I am now going to talk about accounting matters. I owe \\r\\nthis to those Berkshire shareholders who love reading about debits and credits. I hope both of you find this \\r\\ndiscussion helpful. All others can skip this section; there will be no quiz. \\r\\n\\r\\nBerkshire has done many retroactive transactions - in both number and amount a multiple of such \\r\\npolicies entered into by any other insurer. We are the reinsurer of choice for these coverages because the \\r\\nobligations that are transferred to us - for example, lifetime indemnity and medical payments to be made to \\r\\ninjured workers - may not be fully satisfied for 50 years or more. No other company can offer the certainty \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n9 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nthat Berkshire can, in terms of guaranteeing the full and fair settlement of these obligations. This fact is \\r\\nimportant to the original insurer, policyholders and regulators. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe accounting procedure for retroactive transactions is neither well known nor intuitive. The \\r\\nbest way for shareholders to understand it, therefore, is for us to simply lay out the debits and credits. \\r\\nCharlie and I would like to see this done more often. We sometimes encounter accounting footnotes about \\r\\nimportant transactions that leave us baffled, and we go away suspicious that the reporting company wished \\r\\nit that way. (For example, try comprehending transactions \"described\" in the old 10-Ks of Enron, even \\r\\nafter you know how the movie ended.) \\r\\n\\r\\nSo let us summarize our accounting for the Equitas transaction. The major debits will be to Cash \\r\\nand Investments, Reinsurance Recoverable, and Deferred Charges for Reinsurance Assumed (\"DCRA\"). \\r\\nThe major credit will be to Reserve for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expense. No profit or loss will be \\r\\nrecorded at the inception of the transaction, but underwriting losses will thereafter be incurred annually as \\r\\nthe DCRA asset is amortized downward. The amount of the annual amortization charge will be primarily \\r\\ndetermined by how our end-of-the-year estimates as to the timing and amount of future loss payments \\r\\ncompare to the estimates made at the beginning of the year. Eventually, when the last claim has been paid, \\r\\nthe DCRA account will be reduced to zero. That day is 50 years or more away. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhat\\'s important to remember is that retroactive insurance contracts always produce underwriting \\r\\nlosses for us. Whether these losses are worth experiencing depends on whether the cash we have received \\r\\nproduces investment income that exceeds the losses. Recently our DCRA charges have annually delivered \\r\\n$300 million or so of underwriting losses, which have been more than offset by the income we have \\r\\nrealized through use of the cash we received as a premium. Absent new retroactive contracts, the amount \\r\\nof the annual charge would normally decline over time. After the Equitas transaction, however, the annual \\r\\nDCRA cost will initially increase to about $450 million a year. This means that our other insurance \\r\\noperations must generate at least that much underwriting gain for our overall float to be cost-free. That \\r\\namount is quite a hurdle but one that I believe we will clear in many, if not most, years. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAren\\'t you glad that I promised you there would be no quiz? \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nManufacturing, Service and Retailing Operations \\r\\n\\r\\nOur activities in this part of Berkshire cover the waterfront. Let\\'s look, though, at a summary \\r\\nbalance sheet and earnings statement for the entire group. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBalance Sheet 12/31/06 (in millions) \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAssets \\r\\n\\r\\nCash and equivalents \\r\\n\\r\\nAccounts and notes receivable . \\r\\n\\r\\nInventory \\r\\n\\r\\nOther current assets \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal current assets \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n& 1,543 \\r\\n3,793 \\r\\n5,257 \\r\\n363 \\r\\n10,956 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLiabilities and Equity \\r\\n\\r\\nNotes payable $ 1,468 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther current liabilities 6,635 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal current liabilities 8,103 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGoodwill and other intangibles 13,314 Deferred taxes 540 \\r\\n\\r\\nFixed assets 8,934 Term debt and other liabilities... 3,014 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther assets 1,168 Equity 22,715 \\r\\n\\r\\n$34.372 $34.372 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n10 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEarnings Statement (in millions) \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n2006 \\r\\n\\r\\n2005 \\r\\n\\r\\n2004 \\r\\n\\r\\nRevenues \\r\\n\\r\\n$52,660 \\r\\n\\r\\n$46,896 \\r\\n\\r\\n$44,142 \\r\\n\\r\\nOperating expenses (including depreciation of $823 in 2006, \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n$699 in 2005 and $676 in 2004) \\r\\n\\r\\n49,002 \\r\\n\\r\\n44,190 \\r\\n\\r\\n41,604 \\r\\n\\r\\nInterest expense \\r\\n\\r\\n132 \\r\\n\\r\\n83 \\r\\n\\r\\n57 \\r\\n\\r\\nPre-tax earnings \\r\\n\\r\\n3,526* \\r\\n\\r\\n2,623* \\r\\n\\r\\n2,481* \\r\\n\\r\\nIncome taxes and minority interests \\r\\n\\r\\n1,395 \\r\\n\\r\\n977 \\r\\n\\r\\n941 \\r\\n\\r\\nNet income \\r\\n\\r\\n$ 2,131 \\r\\n\\r\\n$ 1.646 \\r\\n\\r\\n$ 1.540 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*Does not include purchase-accounting adjustments. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis motley group, which sells products ranging from lollipops to motor homes, earned a pleasing \\r\\n25% on average tangible net worth last year. It\\'s noteworthy also that these operations used only minor \\r\\nfinancial leverage in achieving that return. Clearly we own some terrific businesses. We purchased many \\r\\nof them, however, at large premiums to net worth - a point reflected in the goodwill item shown on the \\r\\nbalance sheet - and that fact reduces the earnings on our average carrying value to 10.8%. \\r\\n\\r\\nHere are a few newsworthy items about companies in this sector: \\r\\n\\r\\n• Bob Shaw, a remarkable entrepreneur who from a standing start built Shaw Industries into the \\r\\ncountry\\'s largest carpet producer, elected last year, at age 75, to retire. To succeed him, Bob \\r\\nrecommended Vance Bell, a 31-year veteran at Shaw, and Bob, as usual, made the right call. \\r\\nWeakness in housing has caused the carpet business to slow. Shaw, however, remains a \\r\\npowerhouse and a major contributor to Berkshire\\'s earnings. \\r\\n\\r\\n• MiTek, a manufacturer of connectors for roof trusses at the time we purchased it in 2001, is \\r\\ndeveloping into a mini-conglomerate. At the rate it is growing, in fact, \"mini\" may soon be \\r\\ninappropriate. In purchasing MiTek for $420 million, we lent the company $200 million at 9% \\r\\nand bought $198 million of stock, priced at $10,000 per share. Additionally, 55 employees bought \\r\\n2,200 shares for $22 million. Each employee paid exactly the same price that we did, in most \\r\\ncases borrowing money to do so. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd are they ever glad they did! Five years later, MiTek\\' s sales have tripled and the stock is \\r\\nvalued at $71,699 per share. Despite its making 14 acquisitions, at a cost of $291 million, MiTek \\r\\nhas paid off its debt to Berkshire and holds $35 million of cash. We celebrated the fifth \\r\\nanniversary of our purchase with a party in July. I told the group that it would be embarrassing if \\r\\nMiTek\\'s stock price soared beyond that of Berkshire \"A\" shares. Don\\'t be surprised, however, if \\r\\nthat happens (though Charlie and I will try to make our shares a moving target). \\r\\n\\r\\n• Not all of our businesses are destined to increase profits. When an industry\\'s underlying \\r\\neconomics are crumbling, talented management may slow the rate of decline. Eventually, though, \\r\\neroding fundamentals will overwhelm managerial brilliance. (As a wise friend told me long ago, \\r\\n\"If you want to get a reputation as a good businessman, be sure to get into a good business.\") And \\r\\nfundamentals are definitely eroding in the newspaper industry, a trend that has caused the profits \\r\\nof our Buffalo News to decline. The skid will almost certainly continue. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Charlie and I were young, the newspaper business was as easy a way to make huge returns \\r\\nas existed in America. As one not-too-bright publisher famously said, \"I owe my fortune to two \\r\\ngreat American institutions: monopoly and nepotism.\" No paper in a one -paper city, however bad \\r\\nthe product or however inept the management, could avoid gushing profits. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe industry\\'s staggering returns could be simply explained. For most of the 20 th Century, \\r\\nnewspapers were the primary source of information for the American public. Whether the subject \\r\\nwas sports, finance, or politics, newspapers reigned supreme. Just as important, their ads were the \\r\\neasiest way to find job opportunities or to learn the price of groceries at your town\\'s supermarkets. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n11 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe great majority of families therefore felt the need for a paper every day, but understandably \\r\\nmost didn\\'t wish to pay for two. Advertisers preferred the paper with the most circulation, and \\r\\nreaders tended to want the paper with the most ads and news pages. This circularity led to a law \\r\\nof the newspaper jungle: Survival of the Fattest. \\r\\n\\r\\nThus, when two or more papers existed in a major city (which was almost universally the case a \\r\\ncentury ago), the one that pulled ahead usually emerged as the stand-alone winner. After \\r\\ncompetition disappeared, the paper\\'s pricing power in both advertising and circulation was \\r\\nunleashed. Typically, rates for both advertisers and readers would be raised annually - and the \\r\\nprofits rolled in. For owners this was economic heaven. (Interestingly, though papers regularly - \\r\\nand often in a disapproving way - reported on the profitability of, say, the auto or steel industries, \\r\\nthey never enlightened readers about their own Midas-like situation. Hmmm . . .) \\r\\n\\r\\nAs long ago as my 1991 letter to shareholders, I nonetheless asserted that this insulated world was \\r\\nchanging, writing that \"the media businesses . . . will prove considerably less marvelous than I, the \\r\\nindustry, or lenders thought would be the case only a few years ago.\" Some publishers took \\r\\numbrage at both this remark and other warnings from me that followed. Newspaper properties, \\r\\nmoreover, continued to sell as if they were indestructible slot machines. In fact, many intelligent \\r\\nnewspaper executives who regularly chronicled and analyzed important worldwide events were \\r\\neither blind or indifferent to what was going on under their noses. \\r\\n\\r\\nNow, however, almost all newspaper owners realize that they are constantly losing ground in the \\r\\nbattle for eyeballs. Simply put, if cable and satellite broadcasting, as well as the internet, had \\r\\ncome along first, newspapers as we know them probably would never have existed. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn Berkshire\\'s world, Stan Lipsey does a terrific job running the Buffalo News, and I am \\r\\nenormously proud of its editor, Margaret Sullivan. The News\\' penetration of its market is the \\r\\nhighest among that of this country\\'s large newspapers. We also do better financially than most \\r\\nmetropolitan newspapers, even though Buffalo\\'s population and business trends are not good. \\r\\nNevertheless, this operation faces unrelenting pressures that will cause profit margins to slide. \\r\\n\\r\\nTrue, we have the leading online news operation in Buffalo, and it will continue to attract more \\r\\nviewers and ads. However, the economic potential of a newspaper internet site - given the many \\r\\nalternative sources of information and entertainment that are free and only a click away - is at best \\r\\na small fraction of that existing in the past for a print newspaper facing no competition. \\r\\n\\r\\nFor a local resident, ownership of a city\\'s paper, like ownership of a sports team, still produces \\r\\ninstant prominence. With it typically comes power and influence. These are ruboffs that appeal to \\r\\nmany people with money. Beyond that, civic-minded, wealthy individuals may feel that local \\r\\nownership will serve their community well. That\\'s why Peter Kiewit bought the Omaha paper \\r\\nmore than 40 years ago. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe are likely therefore to see non-economic individual buyers of newspapers emerge, just as we \\r\\nhave seen such buyers acquire major sports franchises. Aspiring press lords should be careful, \\r\\nhowever: There\\'s no rule that says a newspaper\\'s revenues can\\'t fall below its expenses and that \\r\\nlosses can\\'t mushroom. Fixed costs are high in the newspaper business, and that\\'s bad news when \\r\\nunit volume heads south. As the importance of newspapers diminishes, moreover, the \"psychic\" \\r\\nvalue of possessing one will wane, whereas owning a sports franchise will likely retain its cachet. \\r\\n\\r\\nUnless we face an irreversible cash drain, we will stick with the News, just as we\\'ve said that we \\r\\nwould. (Read economic principle 1 1, on page 76.) Charlie and I love newspapers - we each read \\r\\nfive a day - and believe that a free and energetic press is a key ingredient for maintaining a great \\r\\ndemocracy. We hope that some combination of print and online will ward off economic \\r\\ndoomsday for newspapers, and we will work hard in Buffalo to develop a sustainable business \\r\\nmodel. I think we will be successful. But the days of lush profits from our newspaper are over. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n12 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n• A much improved situation is emerging at NetJets, which sells and manages fractionally-owned \\r\\naircraft. This company has never had a problem growing: Revenues from flight operations have \\r\\nincreased 596% since our purchase in 1998. But profits had been erratic. \\r\\n\\r\\nOur move to Europe, which began in 1996, was particularly expensive. After five years of \\r\\noperation there, we had acquired only 80 customers. And by mid-year 2006 our cumulative pre- \\r\\ntax loss had risen to $212 million. But European demand has now exploded, with a net of 589 \\r\\ncustomers having been added in 2005-2006. Under Mark Booth\\'s brilliant leadership, NetJets is \\r\\nnow operating profitably in Europe, and we expect the positive trend to continue. \\r\\n\\r\\nOur U.S. operation also had a good year in 2006, which led to worldwide pre-tax earnings of $143 \\r\\nmillion at NetJets last year. We made this profit even though we suffered a loss of $19 million in \\r\\nthe first quarter. \\r\\n\\r\\nCredit Rich Santulli, along with Mark, for this turnaround. Rich, like many of our managers, has \\r\\nno financial need to work. But you\\'d never know it. He\\'s absolutely tireless - monitoring \\r\\noperations, making sales, and traveling the globe to constantly widen the already-enormous lead \\r\\nthat NetJets enjoys over its competitors. Today, the value of the fleet we manage is far greater \\r\\nthan that managed by our three largest competitors combined. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere\\'s a reason NetJets is the runaway leader: It offers the ultimate in safety and service. At \\r\\nBerkshire, and at a number of our subsidiaries, NetJets aircraft are an indispensable business tool. \\r\\nI also have a contract for personal use with NetJets and so do members of my family and most \\r\\nBerkshire directors. (None of us, I should add, gets a discount.) Once you\\'ve flown NetJets, \\r\\nreturning to commercial flights is like going back to holding hands. \\r\\n\\r\\nRegulated Utility Business \\r\\n\\r\\nBerkshire has an 86.6% (fully diluted) interest in MidAmerican Energy Holdings, which owns a \\r\\nwide variety of utility operations. The largest of these are (1) Yorkshire Electricity and Northern Electric, \\r\\nwhose 3.7 million electric customers make it the third largest distributor of electricity in the U.K.; (2) \\r\\nMidAmerican Energy, which serves 706,000 electric customers, primarily in Iowa; (3) Pacific Power and \\r\\nRocky Mountain Power, serving about 1.7 million electric customers in six western states; and (4) Kern \\r\\nRiver and Northern Natural pipelines, which carry about 8% of the natural gas consumed in the U.S. \\r\\n\\r\\nOur partners in ownership of MidAmerican are Walter Scott, and its two terrific managers, Dave \\r\\nSokol and Greg Abel. It\\'s unimportant how many votes each party has; we will make major moves only \\r\\nwhen we are unanimous in thinking them wise. Six years of working with Dave, Greg and Walter have \\r\\nunderscored my original belief: Berkshire couldn\\'t have better partners. \\r\\n\\r\\nSomewhat incongruously, MidAmerican owns the second largest real estate brokerage firm in the \\r\\nU.S., HomeServices of America. This company operates through 20 locally-branded firms with 20,300 \\r\\nagents. Despite HomeServices\\' purchase of two operations last year, the company\\'s overall volume fell \\r\\n9% to $58 billion, and profits fell 50%. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe slowdown in residential real estate activity stems in part from the weakened lending practices \\r\\nof recent years. The \"optional\" contracts and \"teaser\" rates that have been popular have allowed borrowers \\r\\nto make payments in the early years of their mortgages that fall far short of covering normal interest costs. \\r\\nNaturally, there are few defaults when virtually nothing is required of a borrower. As a cynic has said, \"A \\r\\nrolling loan gathers no loss.\" But payments not made add to principal, and borrowers who can\\'t afford \\r\\nnormal monthly payments early on are hit later with above-normal monthly obligations. This is the Scarlett \\r\\nO\\'Hara scenario: \"I\\'ll think about that tomorrow.\" For many home owners, \"tomorrow\" has now arrived. \\r\\nConsequently there is a huge overhang of offerings in several of HomeServices\\' markets. \\r\\n\\r\\nNevertheless, we will be seeking to purchase additional brokerage operations. A decade from \\r\\nnow, HomeServices will almost certainly be much larger. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n13 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHere are some key figures on MidAmerican\\' s operations: \\r\\n\\r\\nEarnings (in $ millions) \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n2006 2005 \\r\\n\\r\\nU.K. utilities $ 338 $ 308 \\r\\n\\r\\nIowa utility 348 288 \\r\\n\\r\\nWestern utilities (acquired March 21, 2006) 356 N/A \\r\\n\\r\\nPipelines 376 309 \\r\\n\\r\\nHomeServices 74 148 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther (net) 226 115 \\r\\n\\r\\nEarnings before corporate interest and taxes 1,718 1,168 \\r\\n\\r\\nInterest, other than to Berkshire (261) (200) \\r\\n\\r\\nInterest on Berkshire junior debt (134) (157) \\r\\n\\r\\nIncome tax (407) (248) \\r\\n\\r\\nNet earnings $ 916 $ 563 \\r\\n\\r\\nEarnings applicable to Berkshire* $ 885 $ 523 \\r\\n\\r\\nDebt owed to others 1 6,946 1 0,296 \\r\\n\\r\\nDebt owed to Berkshire 1 ,055 1 ,289 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n* Includes interest earned by Berkshire (net of related income taxes) of $87 in 2006 and $102 in 2005. \\r\\n\\r\\nFinance and Financial Products \\r\\n\\r\\nYou will be happy to hear - and I\\'m even happier - that this will be my last discussion of the \\r\\nlosses at Gen Re\\'s derivative operation. When we started to wind this business down early in 2002, we had \\r\\n23,218 contracts outstanding. Now we have 197. Our cumulative pre-tax loss from this operation totals \\r\\n$409 million, but only $5 million occurred in 2006. Charlie says that if we had properly classified the $409 \\r\\nmillion on our 2001 balance sheet, it would have been labeled \"Good Until Reached For.\" In any event, a \\r\\nShakespearean thought - slightly modified - seems appropriate for the tombstone of this derivative \\r\\nbusiness: \"All\\'s well that ends.\" \\r\\n\\r\\nWe\\'ve also wound up our investment in Value Capital. So earnings or losses from these two lines \\r\\nof business are making their final appearance in the table that annually appears in this section. \\r\\n\\r\\nClayton Homes remains an anomaly in the manufactured-housing industry, which last year \\r\\nrecorded its lowest unit sales since 1962. Indeed, the industry\\'s volume last year was only about one-third \\r\\nthat of 1999. Outside of Clayton, I doubt if the industry, overall, made any money in 2006. \\r\\n\\r\\nYet Clayton earned $513 million pre-tax and paid Berkshire an additional $86 million as a fee for \\r\\nour obtaining the funds to finance Clayton\\'s $10 billion portfolio of installment receivables. Berkshire\\'s \\r\\nfinancial strength has clearly been of huge help to Clayton. But the driving force behind the company\\'s \\r\\nsuccess is Kevin Clayton. Kevin knows the business forward and backward, is a rational decision-maker \\r\\nand a joy to work with. Because of acquisitions, Clayton now employs 14,787 people, compared to 6,661 \\r\\nat the time of our purchase. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe have two leasing operations: CORT (furniture), run by Paul Arnold, and XTRA (truck \\r\\ntrailers), run by Bill Franz. CORT\\'s earnings improved significantly last year, and XTRA\\'s remained at \\r\\nthe high level attained in 2005. We continue to look for tuck-in acquisitions to be run by Paul or Bill, and \\r\\nalso are open to ideas for new leasing opportunities. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n14 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHere\\'s a breakdown of earnings in this sector: \\r\\n\\r\\n(in millions) \\r\\n\\r\\nPre-Tax Earnings Interest-Bearing Liabilities \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n2006 \\r\\n\\r\\n2005 \\r\\n\\r\\n2006 \\r\\n\\r\\n2005 \\r\\n\\r\\nTrading - ordinary income \\r\\n\\r\\n$ 274 \\r\\n\\r\\n$ 200 \\r\\n\\r\\n$ 600 \\r\\n\\r\\n$1,061 \\r\\n\\r\\nGen Re Securities (loss) \\r\\n\\r\\n(5) \\r\\n\\r\\n(104) \\r\\n\\r\\n1,204* \\r\\n\\r\\n2,617* \\r\\n\\r\\nLife and annuity operation \\r\\n\\r\\n29 \\r\\n\\r\\n11 \\r\\n\\r\\n2,459 \\r\\n\\r\\n2,461 \\r\\n\\r\\nValue Capital (loss) \\r\\n\\r\\n6 \\r\\n\\r\\n(33) \\r\\n\\r\\nN/A \\r\\n\\r\\nN/A \\r\\n\\r\\nLeasing operations \\r\\n\\r\\n182 \\r\\n\\r\\n173 \\r\\n\\r\\n261 \\r\\n\\r\\n370 \\r\\n\\r\\nManufactured-housing finance (Clayton) \\r\\n\\r\\n513 \\r\\n\\r\\n416 \\r\\n\\r\\n10,498 \\r\\n\\r\\n9,299 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther \\r\\n\\r\\n158 \\r\\n\\r\\n159 \\r\\n\\r\\nN/A \\r\\n\\r\\nN/A \\r\\n\\r\\nIncome before capital gains \\r\\n\\r\\n1,157 \\r\\n\\r\\n822 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTrading - capital gains (losses) \\r\\n\\r\\n938 \\r\\n\\r\\n(234) \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTotal \\r\\n\\r\\n$ 2.095 \\r\\n\\r\\n$ 588 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*Includes all liabilities \\r\\nInvestments \\r\\n\\r\\nWe show below our common stock investments.

Last year, we \\r\\ntold you that our expectation was that these companies, in aggregate, would increase their earnings by 6% \\r\\nto 8% annually, a rate that would double their earnings every ten years or so. In 2006 American Express, \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n15 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCoca-Cola, Procter & Gamble and Wells Fargo, our largest holdings, increased per-share earnings by 18%, \\r\\n9%, 8% and 11%. These are stellar results, and we thank their CEOs. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe\\'ve come close to eliminating our direct foreign-exchange position, from which we realized \\r\\nabout $186 million in pre-tax profits in 2006 (earnings that were included in the Finance and Financial \\r\\nProducts table shown earlier). That brought our total gain since inception of this position in 2002 to $2.2 \\r\\nbillion. Here\\'s a breakdown by currency: \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal Gain (Loss) in Millions \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAustralian dollar $247.1 Mexican peso $106.1 \\r\\n\\r\\nBritish pound 287.2 New Zealand dollar 102.6 \\r\\n\\r\\nCanadian dollar 398.3 Singapore dollar (2.6) \\r\\n\\r\\nChinese yuan (12.7) South Korean won 261.3 \\r\\n\\r\\nEuro 839.2 Swiss franc 9.6 \\r\\n\\r\\nHong Kong dollar (2.5) Taiwan dollar (45.3) \\r\\n\\r\\nJapanese yen 1 .9 Miscellaneous options 22.9 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWe\\'ve made large indirect currency profits as well, though I\\'ve never tallied the precise amount. \\r\\nFor example, in 2002-2003 we spent about $82 million buying - of all things - Enron bonds, some of \\r\\nwhich were denominated in Euros. Already we\\'ve received distributions of $179 million from these bonds, \\r\\nand our remaining stake is worth $173 million. That means our overall gain is $270 million, part of which \\r\\ncame from the appreciation of the Euro that took place after our bond purchase. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen we first began making foreign exchange purchases, interest-rate differentials between the \\r\\nU.S. and most foreign countries favored a direct currency position. But that spread turned negative in \\r\\n2005. We therefore looked for other ways to gain foreign-currency exposure, such as the ownership of \\r\\nforeign equities or of U.S. stocks with major earnings abroad. The currency factor, we should emphasize, \\r\\nis not dominant in our selection of equities, but is merely one of many considerations. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs our U.S. trade problems worsen, the probability that the dollar will weaken over time continues \\r\\nto be high. I fervently believe in real trade - the more the better for both us and the world. We had about \\r\\n$1.44 trillion of this honest-to-God trade in 2006. But the U.S. also had $.76 trillion of pseudo-tmde last \\r\\nyear - imports for which we exchanged no goods or services. (Ponder, for a moment, how commentators \\r\\nwould describe the situation if our imports were $.76 trillion - a full 6% of GDP - and we had no exports.) \\r\\nMaking these purchases that weren\\'t reciprocated by sales, the U.S. necessarily transferred ownership of its \\r\\nassets or IOUs to the rest of the world. Like a very wealthy but self-indulgent family, we peeled off a bit of \\r\\nwhat we owned in order to consume more than we produced. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe U.S. can do a lot of this because we are an extraordinarily rich country that has behaved \\r\\nresponsibly in the past. The world is therefore willing to accept our bonds, real estate, stocks and \\r\\nbusinesses. And we have a vast store of these to hand over. \\r\\n\\r\\nThese transfers will have consequences, however. Already the prediction I made last year about \\r\\none fall-out from our spending binge has come true: The \"investment income\" account of our country - \\r\\npositive in every previous year since 1915 - turned negative in 2006. Foreigners now earn more on their \\r\\nU.S. investments than we do on our investments abroad. In effect, we\\'ve used up our bank account and \\r\\nturned to our credit card. And, like everyone who gets in hock, the U.S. will now experience \"reverse \\r\\ncompounding\" as we pay ever-increasing amounts of interest on interest. \\r\\n\\r\\nI want to emphasize that even though our course is unwise, Americans will live better ten or \\r\\ntwenty years from now than they do today. Per-capita wealth will increase. But our citizens will also be \\r\\nforced every year to ship a significant portion of their current production abroad merely to service the cost \\r\\nof our huge debtor position. It won\\'t be pleasant to work part of each day to pay for the over-consumption \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n16 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nof your ancestors. I believe that at some point in the future U.S. workers and voters will find this annual \\r\\n\"tribute\" so onerous that there will be a severe political backlash. How that will play out in markets is \\r\\nimpossible to predict - but to expect a \"soft landing\" seems like wishful thinking. \\r\\n\\r\\nI should mention that all of the direct currency profits we have realized have come from forward \\r\\ncontracts, which are derivatives, and that we have entered into other types of derivatives contracts as well. \\r\\nThat may seem odd, since you know of our expensive experience in unwinding the derivatives book at Gen \\r\\nRe and also have heard me talk of the systemic problems that could result from the enormous growth in the \\r\\nuse of derivatives. Why, you may wonder, are we fooling around with such potentially toxic material? \\r\\n\\r\\nThe answer is that derivatives, just like stocks and bonds, are sometimes wildly mispriced. For \\r\\nmany years, accordingly, we have selectively written derivative contracts - few in number but sometimes \\r\\nfor large dollar amounts. We currently have 62 contracts outstanding. I manage them personally, and they \\r\\nare free of counterparty credit risk. So far, these derivative contracts have worked out well for us, \\r\\nproducing pre-tax profits in the hundreds of millions of dollars (above and beyond the gains I\\'ve itemized \\r\\nfrom forward foreign-exchange contracts). Though we will experience losses from time to time, we are \\r\\nlikely to continue to earn - overall - significant profits from mispriced derivatives. \\r\\n\\r\\nI have told you that Berkshire has three outstanding candidates to replace me as CEO and that the \\r\\nBoard knows exactly who should take over if I should die tonight. Each of the three is much younger than \\r\\nI. The directors believe it\\'s important that my successor have the prospect of a long tenure. \\r\\n\\r\\nFrankly, we are not as well-prepared on the investment side of our business. There\\'s a history \\r\\nhere: At one time, Charlie was my potential replacement for investing, and more recently Lou Simpson has \\r\\nfilled that slot. Lou is a top-notch investor with an outstanding long-term record of managing GEICO\\'s \\r\\nequity portfolio. But he is only six years younger than I. If I were to die soon, he would fill in \\r\\nmagnificently for a short period. For the long-term, though, we need a different answer. \\r\\n\\r\\nAt our October board meeting, we discussed that subject fully. And we emerged with a plan, \\r\\nwhich I will carry out with the help of Charlie and Lou. \\r\\n\\r\\nUnder this plan, I intend to hire a younger man or woman with the potential to manage a very \\r\\nlarge portfolio, who we hope will succeed me as Berkshire\\'s chief investment officer when the need for \\r\\nsomeone to do that arises. As part of the selection process, we may in fact take on several candidates. \\r\\n\\r\\nPicking the right person(s) will not be an easy task. It\\'s not hard, of course, to find smart people, \\r\\namong them individuals who have impressive investment records. But there is far more to successful long- \\r\\nterm investing than brains and performance that has recently been good. \\r\\n\\r\\nOver time, markets will do extraordinary, even bizarre, things. A single, big mistake could wipe \\r\\nout a long string of successes. We therefore need someone genetically programmed to recognize and avoid \\r\\nserious risks, including those never before encountered. Certain perils that lurk in investment strategies \\r\\ncannot be spotted by use of the models commonly employed today by financial institutions. \\r\\n\\r\\nTemperament is also important. Independent thinking, emotional stability, and a keen \\r\\nunderstanding of both human and institutional behavior is vital to long-term investment success. I\\'ve seen \\r\\na lot of very smart people who have lacked these virtues. \\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, we have a special problem to consider: our ability to keep the person we hire. Being able \\r\\nto list Berkshire on a resume would materially enhance the marketability of an investment manager. We \\r\\nwill need, therefore, to be sure we can retain our choice, even though he or she could leave and make much \\r\\nmore money elsewhere. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n17 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are surely people who fit what we need, but they may be hard to identify. In 1979, Jack \\r\\nByrne and I felt we had found such a person in Lou Simpson. We then made an arrangement with him \\r\\nwhereby he would be paid well for sustained overperformance. Under this deal, he has earned large \\r\\namounts. Lou, however, could have left us long ago to manage far greater sums on more advantageous \\r\\nterms. If money alone had been the object, that\\'s exactly what he would have done. But Lou never \\r\\nconsidered such a move. We need to find a younger person or two made of the same stuff. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe good news: At 76, I feel terrific and, according to all measurable indicators, am in excellent \\r\\nhealth. It\\'s amazing what Cherry Coke and hamburgers will do for a fellow. \\r\\n\\r\\nSome Changes on Berkshire\\'s Board \\r\\n\\r\\nThe composition of our board will change in two ways this spring. One change will involve the \\r\\nChace family, which has been connected to Berkshire and its predecessor companies for more than a \\r\\ncentury. In 1929, the first Malcolm G. Chace played an important role in merging four New England \\r\\ntextile operations into Berkshire Fine Spinning Associates. That company merged with Hathaway \\r\\nManufacturing in 1955 to form Berkshire Hathaway, and Malcolm G. Chace, Jr. became its chairman. \\r\\n\\r\\nEarly in 1965, Malcolm arranged for Buffett Partnership Ltd. to buy a key block of Berkshire \\r\\nshares and welcomed us as the new controlling shareholder of the company. Malcolm continued as non- \\r\\nexecutive chairman until 1969. He was both a wonderful gentleman and helpful partner. \\r\\n\\r\\nThat description also fits his son, Malcolm \"Kim\" Chace, who succeeded his father on Berkshire\\'s \\r\\nboard in 1992. But last year Kim, now actively and successfully running a community bank that he \\r\\nfounded in 1996, suggested that we find a younger person to replace him on our board. We have done so, \\r\\nand Kim will step down as a director at the annual meeting. I owe much to the Chaces and wish to thank \\r\\nKim for his many years of service to Berkshire. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn selecting a new director, we were guided by our long-standing criteria, which are that board \\r\\nmembers be owner-oriented, business-savvy, interested and truly independent. I say \"truly\" because many \\r\\ndirectors who are now deemed independent by various authorities and observers are far from that, relying \\r\\nheavily as they do on directors\\' fees to maintain their standard of living. These payments, which come in \\r\\nmany forms, often range between $150,000 and $250,000 annually, compensation that may approach or \\r\\neven exceed all other income of the \"independent\" director. And - surprise, surprise - director \\r\\ncompensation has soared in recent years, pushed up by recommendations from corporate America\\'s \\r\\nfavorite consultant, Ratchet, Ratchet and Bingo. (The name may be phony, but the action it conveys is \\r\\nnot.) \\r\\n\\r\\nCharlie and I believe our four criteria are essential if directors are to do their job - which, by law, \\r\\nis to faithfully represent owners. Yet these criteria are usually ignored. Instead, consultants and CEOs \\r\\nseeking board candidates will often say, \"We\\'re looking for a woman,\" or \"a Hispanic,\" or \"someone from \\r\\nabroad,\" or what have you. It sometimes sounds as if the mission is to stock Noah\\'s ark. Over the years \\r\\nI\\'ve been queried many times about potential directors and have yet to hear anyone ask, \"Does he think like \\r\\nan intelligent owner?\" \\r\\n\\r\\nThe questions I instead get would sound ridiculous to someone seeking candidates for, say, a \\r\\nfootball team, or an arbitration panel or a military command. In those cases, the selectors would look for \\r\\npeople who had the specific talents and attitudes that were required for a specialized job. At Berkshire, we \\r\\nare in the specialized activity of running a business well, and therefore we seek business judgment. \\r\\n\\r\\nThat\\'s exactly what we\\'ve found in Susan Decker, CFO of Yahoo!, who will join our board at the \\r\\nannual meeting. We are lucky to have her: She scores very high on our four criteria and additionally, at 44, \\r\\nis young - an attribute, as you may have noticed, that your Chairman has long lacked. We will seek more \\r\\nyoung directors in the future, but never by slighting the four qualities that we insist upon. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n18 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis and That \\r\\n\\r\\nBerkshire will pay about $4.4 billion in federal income tax on its 2006 earnings. In its last fiscal \\r\\nyear the U.S. Government spent $2.6 trillion, or about $7 billion per day. Thus, for more than half of one \\r\\nday, Berkshire picked up the tab for all federal expenditures, ranging from Social Security and Medicare \\r\\npayments to the cost of our armed services. Had there been only 600 taxpayers like Berkshire, no one else \\r\\nin America would have needed to pay any federal income or payroll taxes. \\r\\n\\r\\nOur federal return last year, we should add, ran to 9,386 pages. To handle this filing, state and \\r\\nforeign tax returns, a myriad of SEC requirements, and all of the other matters involved in running \\r\\nBerkshire, we have gone all the way up to 19 employees at World Headquarters. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis crew occupies 9,708 square feet of space, and Charlie - at World Headquarters West in Los \\r\\nAngeles - uses another 655 square feet. Our home-office payroll, including benefits and counting both \\r\\nlocations, totaled $3,531,978 last year. We\\'re careful when spending your money. \\r\\n\\r\\nCorporate bigwigs often complain about government spending, criticizing bureaucrats who they \\r\\nsay spend taxpayers\\' money differently from how they would if it were their own. But sometimes the \\r\\nfinancial behavior of executives will also vary based on whose wallet is getting depleted. Here\\'s an \\r\\nillustrative tale from my days at Salomon. In the 1980s the company had a barber, Jimmy by name, who \\r\\ncame in weekly to give free haircuts to the top brass. A manicurist was also on tap. Then, because of a \\r\\ncost-cutting drive, patrons were told to pay their own way. One top executive (not the CEO) who had \\r\\npreviously visited Jimmy weekly went immediately to a once-every-three-weeks schedule. \\r\\n\\r\\nEvery now and then Charlie and I catch on early to a tide -like trend, one brimming over with \\r\\ncommercial promise. For example, though American Airlines (with its \"miles\") and American Express \\r\\n(with credit card points) are credited as being trailblazers in granting customers \"rewards,\" Charlie and I \\r\\nwere far ahead of them in spotting the appeal of this powerful idea. Excited by our insight, the two of us \\r\\njumped into the reward business way back in 1970 by buying control of a trading stamp operation, Blue \\r\\nChip Stamps. In that year, Blue Chip had sales of $126 million, and its stamps papered California. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1970, indeed, about 60 billion of our stamps were licked by savers, pasted into books, and taken \\r\\nto Blue Chip redemption stores. Our catalog of rewards was 1 16 pages thick and chock full of tantalizing \\r\\nitems. When I was told that even certain brothels and mortuaries gave stamps to their patrons, I felt I had \\r\\nfinally found a sure thing. \\r\\n\\r\\nWell, not quite. From the day Charlie and I stepped into the Blue Chip picture, the business went \\r\\nstraight downhill. By 1980, sales had fallen to $19.4 million. And, by 1990, sales were bumping along at \\r\\n$1.5 million. No quitter, I redoubled my managerial efforts. \\r\\n\\r\\nSales then fell another 98%. Last year, in Berkshire\\'s $98 billion of revenues, all of $25,920 (no \\r\\nzeros omitted) came from Blue Chip. Ever hopeful, Charlie and I soldier on. \\r\\n\\r\\nI mentioned last year that in my service on 19 corporate boards (not counting Berkshire or other \\r\\ncontrolled companies), I have been the Typhoid Mary of compensation committees. At only one company \\r\\nwas I assigned to comp committee duty, and then I was promptly outvoted on the most crucial decision that \\r\\nwe faced. My ostracism has been peculiar, considering that I certainly haven\\'t lacked experience in setting \\r\\nCEO pay. At Berkshire, after all, I am a one-man compensation committee who determines the salaries \\r\\nand incentives for the CEOs of around 40 significant operating businesses. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n19 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHow much time does this aspect of my job take? Virtually none. How many CEOs have \\r\\nvoluntarily left us for other jobs in our 42-year history? Precisely none. \\r\\n\\r\\nBerkshire employs many different incentive arrangements, with their terms depending on such \\r\\nelements as the economic potential or capital intensity of a CEO\\'s business. Whatever the compensation \\r\\narrangement, though, I try to keep it both simple and fair. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen we use incentives - and these can be large - they are always tied to the operating results for \\r\\nwhich a given CEO has authority. We issue no lottery tickets that carry payoffs unrelated to business \\r\\nperformance. If a CEO bats .300, he gets paid for being a .300 hitter, even if circumstances outside of his \\r\\ncontrol cause Berkshire to perform poorly. And if he bats .150, he doesn\\'t get a payoff just because the \\r\\nsuccesses of others have enabled Berkshire to prosper mightily. An example: We now own $61 billion of \\r\\nequities at Berkshire, whose value can easily rise or fall by 10% in a given year. Why in the world should \\r\\nthe pay of our operating executives be affected by such $6 billion swings, however important the gain or \\r\\nloss may be for shareholders? \\r\\n\\r\\nYou\\'ve read loads about CEOs who have received astronomical compensation for mediocre \\r\\nresults. Much less well-advertised is the fact that America\\'s CEOs also generally live the good life. Many, \\r\\nit should be emphasized, are exceptionally able, and almost all work far more than 40 hours a week. But \\r\\nthey are usually treated like royalty in the process. (And we\\'re certainly going to keep it that way at \\r\\nBerkshire. Though Charlie still favors sackcloth and ashes, I prefer to be spoiled rotten. Berkshire owns \\r\\nThe Pampered Chef; our wonderful office group has made me The Pampered Chief.) \\r\\n\\r\\nCEO perks at one company are quickly copied elsewhere. \"All the other kids have one\" may seem \\r\\na thought too juvenile to use as a rationale in the boardroom. But consultants employ precisely this \\r\\nargument, phrased more elegantly of course, when they make recommendations to comp committees. \\r\\n\\r\\nIrrational and excessive comp practices will not be materially changed by disclosure or by \\r\\n\"independent\" comp committee members. Indeed, I think it\\'s likely that the reason I was rejected for \\r\\nservice on so many comp committees was that I was regarded as too independent. Compensation reform \\r\\nwill only occur if the largest institutional shareholders - it would only take a few - demand afresh look at \\r\\nthe whole system. The consultants\\' present drill of deftly selecting \"peer\" companies to compare with their \\r\\nclients will only perpetuate present excesses. \\r\\n\\r\\nLast year I arranged for the bulk of my Berkshire holdings to go to five charitable foundations, \\r\\nthus carrying out part of my lifelong plan to eventually use all of my shares for philanthropic purposes. \\r\\nDetails of the commitments I made, as well as the rationale for them, are posted on our website, \\r\\nwww.berkshirehathaway.com . Taxes, I should note, had nothing to do with my decision or its timing. My \\r\\nfederal and state income taxes in 2006 were exactly what they would have been had I not made my first \\r\\ncontributions last summer, and the same point will apply to my 2007 contributions. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn my will I\\'ve stipulated that the proceeds from all Berkshire shares I still own at death are to be \\r\\nused for philanthropic purposes within ten years after my estate is closed. Because my affairs are not \\r\\ncomplicated, it should take three years at most for this closing to occur. Adding this 13-year period to my \\r\\nexpected lifespan of about 12 years (though, naturally, I\\'m aiming for more) means that proceeds from all \\r\\nof my Berkshire shares will likely be distributed for societal purposes over the next 25 years or so. \\r\\n\\r\\nI\\'ve set this schedule because I want the money to be spent relatively promptly by people I know \\r\\nto be capable, vigorous and motivated. These managerial attributes sometimes wane as institutions - \\r\\nparticularly those that are exempt from market forces - age. Today, there are terrific people in charge at \\r\\nthe five foundations. So at my death, why should they not move with dispatch to judiciously spend the \\r\\nmoney that remains? \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n20 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThose people favoring perpetual foundations argue that in the future there will most certainly be \\r\\nlarge and important societal problems that philanthropy will need to address. I agree. But there will then \\r\\nalso be many super-rich individuals and families whose wealth will exceed that of today\\'s Americans and \\r\\nto whom philanthropic organizations can make their case for funding. These funders can then judge \\r\\nfirsthand which operations have both the vitality and the focus to best address the major societal problems \\r\\nthat then exist. In this way, a market test of ideas and effectiveness can be applied. Some organizations \\r\\nwill deserve major support while others will have outlived their usefulness. Even if the people above \\r\\nground make their decisions imperfectly, they should be able to allocate funds more rationally than a \\r\\ndecedent six feet under will have ordained decades earlier. Wills, of course, can always be rewritten, but \\r\\nit\\'s very unlikely that my thinking will change in a material way. \\r\\n\\r\\nA few shareholders have expressed concern that sales of Berkshire by the foundations receiving \\r\\nshares will depress the stock. These fears are unwarranted. The annual trading volume of many stocks \\r\\nexceeds 100% of the outstanding shares, but nevertheless these stocks usually sell at prices approximating \\r\\ntheir intrinsic value. Berkshire also tends to sell at an appropriate price, but with annual volume that is only \\r\\n15% of shares outstanding. At most, sales by the foundations receiving my shares will add three \\r\\npercentage points to annual trading volume, which will still leave Berkshire with a turnover ratio that is the \\r\\nlowest around. \\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, Berkshire\\'s business performance will determine the price of our stock, and most of the \\r\\ntime it will sell in a zone of reasonableness. It\\'s important that the foundations receive appropriate prices \\r\\nas they periodically sell Berkshire shares, but it\\'s also important that incoming shareholders don\\'t overpay. \\r\\n(See economic principle 14 on page 77.) By both our policies and shareholder communications, Charlie \\r\\nand I will do our best to ensure that Berkshire sells at neither a large discount nor large premium to intrinsic \\r\\nvalue. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe existence of foundation ownership will in no way influence our board\\'s decisions about \\r\\ndividends, repurchases, or the issuance of shares. We will follow exactly the same rule that has guided us \\r\\nin the past: What action will be likely to deliver the best result for shareholders over time? \\r\\n\\r\\nIn last year\\'s report I allegorically described the Gotrocks family - a clan that owned all of \\r\\nAmerica\\'s businesses and that counterproductively attempted to increase its investment returns by paying \\r\\never-greater commissions and fees to \"helpers.\" Sad to say, the \"family\" continued its self-destructive \\r\\nways in 2006. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn part the family persists in this folly because it harbors unrealistic expectations about obtainable \\r\\nreturns. Sometimes these delusions are self-serving. For example, private pension plans can temporarily \\r\\noverstate their earnings, and public pension plans can defer the need for increased taxes, by using \\r\\ninvestment assumptions that are likely to be out of reach. Actuaries and auditors go along with these \\r\\ntactics, and it can be decades before the chickens come home to roost (at which point the CEO or public \\r\\nofficial who misled the world is apt to be gone). \\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile, Wall Street\\'s Pied Pipers of Performance will have encouraged the futile hopes of the \\r\\nfamily. The hapless Gotrocks will be assured that they all can achieve above-average investment \\r\\nperformance - but only by paying ever-higher fees. Call this promise the adult version of Lake Woebegon. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2006, promises and fees hit new highs. A flood of money went from institutional investors to \\r\\nthe 2-and-20 crowd. For those innocent of this arrangement, let me explain: It\\'s a lopsided system whereby \\r\\n2% of your principal is paid each year to the manager even if he accomplishes nothing - or, for that matter, \\r\\nloses you a bundle - and, additionally, 20% of your profit is paid to him if he succeeds, even if his success \\r\\nis due simply to a rising tide. For example, a manager who achieves a gross return of 10% in a year will \\r\\nkeep 3.6 percentage points - two points off the top plus 20% of the residual 8 points - leaving only 6.4 \\r\\npercentage points for his investors. On a $3 billion fund, this 6.4% net \"performance\" will deliver the \\r\\nmanager a cool $108 million. He will receive this bonanza even though an index fund might have returned \\r\\n15% to investors in the same period and charged them only a token fee. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n21 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe inexorable math of this grotesque arrangement is certain to make the Gotrocks family poorer \\r\\nover time than it would have been had it never heard of these \"hyper-helpers.\" Even so, the 2-and-20 \\r\\naction spreads. Its effects bring to mind the old adage: When someone with experience proposes a deal to \\r\\nsomeone with money, too often the fellow with money ends up with the experience, and the fellow with \\r\\nexperience ends up with the money. \\r\\n\\r\\nLet me end this section by telling you about one of the good guys of Wall Street, my long-time \\r\\nfriend Walter Schloss, who last year turned 90. From 1956 to 2002, Walter managed a remarkably \\r\\nsuccessful investment partnership, from which he took not a dime unless his investors made money. My \\r\\nadmiration for Walter, it should be noted, is not based on hindsight. A full fifty years ago, Walter was my \\r\\nsole recommendation to a St. Louis family who wanted an honest and able investment manager. \\r\\n\\r\\nWalter did not go to business school, or for that matter, college. His office contained one file \\r\\ncabinet in 1956; the number mushroomed to four by 2002. Walter worked without a secretary, clerk or \\r\\nbookkeeper, his only associate being his son, Edwin, a graduate of the North Carolina School of the Arts. \\r\\nWalter and Edwin never came within a mile of inside information. Indeed, they used \"outside\" information \\r\\nonly sparingly, generally selecting securities by certain simple statistical methods Walter learned while \\r\\nworking for Ben Graham. When Walter and Edwin were asked in 1989 by Outstanding Investors Digest, \\r\\n\"How would you summarize your approach?\" Edwin replied, \"We try to buy stocks cheap.\" So much for \\r\\nModern Portfolio Theory, technical analysis, macroeconomic thoughts and complex algorithms. \\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing a strategy that involved no real risk - defined as permanent loss of capital - Walter \\r\\nproduced results over his 47 partnership years that dramatically surpassed those of the S&P 500. It\\'s \\r\\nparticularly noteworthy that he built this record by investing in about 1,000 securities, mostly of a \\r\\nlackluster type. A few big winners did not account for his success. It\\'s safe to say that had millions of \\r\\ninvestment managers made trades by a) drawing stock names from a hat; b) purchasing these stocks in \\r\\ncomparable amounts when Walter made a purchase; and then c) selling when Walter sold his pick, the \\r\\nluckiest of them would not have come close to equaling his record. There is simply no possibility that what \\r\\nWalter achieved over 47 years was due to chance. \\r\\n\\r\\nI first publicly discussed Walter\\'s remarkable record in 1984. At that time \"efficient market \\r\\ntheory\" (EMT) was the centerpiece of investment instruction at most major business schools. This theory, \\r\\nas then most commonly taught, held that the price of any stock at any moment is not demonstrably \\r\\nmispriced, which means that no investor can be expected to overperform the stock market averages using \\r\\nonly publicly-available information (though some will do so by luck). When I talked about Walter 23 years \\r\\nago, his record forcefully contradicted this dogma. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd what did members of the academic community do when they were exposed to this new and \\r\\nimportant evidence? Unfortunately, they reacted in all-too-human fashion: Rather than opening their \\r\\nminds, they closed their eyes. To my knowledge no business school teaching EMT made any attempt to \\r\\nstudy Walter\\'s performance and what it meant for the school\\'s cherished theory. \\r\\n\\r\\nInstead, the faculties of the schools went merrily on their way presenting EMT as having the \\r\\ncertainty of scripture. Typically, a finance instructor who had the nerve to question EMT had about as \\r\\nmuch chance of major promotion as Galileo had of being named Pope. \\r\\n\\r\\nTens of thousands of students were therefore sent out into life believing that on every day the price \\r\\nof every stock was \"right\" (or, more accurately, not demonstrably wrong) and that attempts to evaluate \\r\\nbusinesses - that is, stocks - were useless. Walter meanwhile went on overperforming, his job made easier \\r\\nby the misguided instructions that had been given to those young minds. After all, if you are in the \\r\\nshipping business, it\\'s helpful to have all of your potential competitors be taught that the earth is flat. \\r\\n\\r\\nMaybe it was a good thing for his investors that Walter didn\\'t go to college. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n22 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Annual Meeting \\r\\n\\r\\nOur meeting this year will be held on Saturday, May 5 th . As always, the doors will open at the \\r\\nQwest Center at 7 a.m., and a new Berkshire movie will be shown at 8:30. At 9:30 we will go directly to \\r\\nthe question-and-answer period, which (with a break for lunch at the Qwest\\' s stands) will last until 3:00. \\r\\nThen, after a short recess, Charlie and I will convene the annual meeting at 3:15. If you decide to leave \\r\\nduring the day\\'s question periods, please do so while Charlie is talking. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe best reason to exit, of course is to shop. We will help you do that by filling the 194,300 \\r\\nsquare foot hall that adjoins the meeting area with the products of Berkshire subsidiaries. Last year, the \\r\\n24,000 people who came to the meeting did their part, and almost every location racked up record sales. \\r\\nBut records are made to be broken, and I know you can do better. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis year we will again showcase a Clayton home (featuring Acme brick, Shaw carpet, Johns \\r\\nManville insulation, MiTek fasteners, Carefree awnings and NFM furniture). You will find that the home, \\r\\npriced at $139,900, delivers excellent value. Last year, a helper at the Qwest bought one of two homes on \\r\\ndisplay well before we opened the doors to shareholders. Flanking the Clayton home on the exhibition \\r\\nfloor this year will be an RV and pontoon boat from Forest River. \\r\\n\\r\\nGEICO will have a booth staffed by a number of its top counselors from around the country, all of \\r\\nthem ready to supply you with auto insurance quotes. In most cases, GEICO will be able to give you a \\r\\nspecial shareholder discount (usually 8%). This special offer is permitted by 45 of the 50 jurisdictions in \\r\\nwhich we operate. (One supplemental point: The discount is not additive if you qualify for another, such as \\r\\nthat given certain groups.) Bring the details of your existing insurance and check out whether we can save \\r\\nyou money. For at least 50% of you, I believe we can. And while you\\'re at it, sign up for the new GEICO \\r\\ncredit card. It\\'s the one I now use (sparingly, of course). \\r\\n\\r\\nOn Saturday, at the Omaha airport, we will have the usual array of aircraft from NetJets available \\r\\nfor your inspection. Stop by the NetJets booth at the Qwest to learn about viewing these planes. Come to \\r\\nOmaha by bus; leave in your new plane. And take all the hair gel that you wish on board with you. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Bookworm\\'s corner of our bazaar, there will be about 25 books and DVDs - all discounted \\r\\n- led again by Poor Charlie\\'s Almanack. (One hapless soul last year asked Charlie what he should do if he \\r\\ndidn\\'t enjoy the book. Back came a Mungerism: \"No problem - just give it to someone more intelligent.\") \\r\\nWe\\'ve added a few titles this year. Among them are Seeking Wisdom: From Darwin to Munger by Peter \\r\\nBevelin, a long-time Swedish shareholder of Berkshire, and Fred Schwed\\'s classic, Where are the \\r\\nCustomers\\' Yachts? This book was first published in 1940 and is now in its 4 th edition. The funniest book \\r\\never written about investing, it lightly delivers many truly important messages on the subject. \\r\\n\\r\\nAn attachment to the proxy material that is enclosed with this report explains how you can obtain \\r\\nthe credential you will need for admission to the meeting and other events. As for plane, hotel and car \\r\\nreservations, we have again signed up American Express (800-799-6634) to give you special help. Carol \\r\\nPedersen, who handles these matters, does a terrific job for us each year, and I thank her for it. Hotel \\r\\nrooms can be hard to find, but work with Carol and you will get one. \\r\\n\\r\\nAt Nebraska Furniture Mart, located on a 77-acre site on 72 nd Street between Dodge and Pacific, \\r\\nwe will again be having \"Berkshire Weekend\" discount pricing. We initiated this special event at NFM ten \\r\\nyears ago, and sales during the \"Weekend\" grew from $5.3 million in 1997 to $30 million in 2006. I get \\r\\ngoose bumps just thinking about this volume. \\r\\n\\r\\nTo obtain the Berkshire discount, you must make your purchases between Thursday, May 3 ld and \\r\\nMonday, May 7 th inclusive, and also present your meeting credential. The period\\'s special pricing will \\r\\neven apply to the products of several prestigious manufacturers that normally have ironclad rules against \\r\\ndiscounting but which, in the spirit of our shareholder weekend, have made an exception for you. We \\r\\nappreciate their cooperation. NFM is open from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday through Saturday, and 10 a.m. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n23 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nto 6 p.m. on Sunday. On Saturday this year, from 5:30 p.m. to 8 p.m., NFM is having a special shareholder \\r\\npicnic featuring chicken and beef tacos (and hamburgers for traditionalists like me). \\r\\n\\r\\nAt a remodeled and expanded Borsheim\\'s, we will again have two shareholder-only events. The \\r\\nfirst will be a cocktail reception from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. on Friday, May 4 th . The second, the main gala, will \\r\\nbe held on Sunday, May 6 th , from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. On Saturday, we will be open until 6 p.m. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe will have huge crowds at Borsheim\\'s throughout the weekend. For your convenience, \\r\\ntherefore, shareholder prices will be available from Monday, April 30 th through Saturday, May 12 th . \\r\\nDuring that period, please identify yourself as a shareholder by presenting your meeting credentials or a \\r\\nbrokerage statement that shows you are a Berkshire holder. \\r\\n\\r\\nOn Sunday, in a tent outside of Borsheim\\'s, a blindfolded Patrick Wolff, twice U.S. chess \\r\\nchampion, will take on all comers - who will have their eyes wide open - in groups of six. Last year I \\r\\ncarried on a conversation with Patrick while he played in this manner. Nearby, Norman Beck, a \\r\\nremarkable magician from Dallas, will bewilder onlookers. Additionally, we will have Bob Hamman and \\r\\nSharon Osberg, two of the world\\'s top bridge experts, available to play bridge with our shareholders on \\r\\nSunday afternoon. \\r\\n\\r\\nTo add to the Sunday fun at Borsheim\\'s, Ariel Hsing will play table tennis (ping-pong to the \\r\\nuninitiated) from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. against anyone brave enough to take her on. Ariel, though only 11, is \\r\\nranked number one among girls under 16 in the U.S. (and number 1 among both boys and girls under 12). \\r\\nThe week I turned 75 I played Ariel, then 9 and barely tall enough to see across the table, thinking I would \\r\\ntake it easy on her so as not to crush her young spirit. Instead she crushed me. I\\'ve since devised a plan \\r\\nthat will give me a chance against her. At 1 p.m. on Sunday, I will initiate play with a 2-point game against \\r\\nAriel. If I somehow win the first point, I will then feign injury and claim victory. After this strenuous \\r\\nencounter wears Ariel down, our shareholders can then try their luck against her. \\r\\n\\r\\nGorat\\'s will again be open exclusively for Berkshire shareholders on Sunday, May 6 th , and will be \\r\\nserving from 4 p.m. until 10 p.m. Please remember that to come to Gorat\\'s on that day, you must have a \\r\\nreservation. To make one, call 402-551-3733 on April 1 st {but not before). \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 2006-2007 school year, 35 university classes, including one from IBMEC in Brazil, will \\r\\ncome to Omaha for sessions with me. I take almost all - in aggregate, more than 2,000 students - to lunch \\r\\nat Gorat\\'s. And they love it. To learn why, come join us on Sunday. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe will again have a reception at 4 p.m. on Saturday afternoon for shareholders who have come \\r\\nfrom outside of North America. Every year our meeting draws many people from around the globe, and \\r\\nCharlie and I want to be sure we personally greet those who have come so far. Last year we enjoyed \\r\\nmeeting more than 400 of you from many dozens of countries. Any shareholder who comes from other \\r\\nthan the U.S. or Canada will be given a special credential and instructions for attending this function. \\r\\n\\r\\nCharlie and I are extraordinarily lucky. We were born in America; had terrific parents who saw \\r\\nthat we got good educations; have enjoyed wonderful families and great health; and came equipped with a \\r\\n\"business\" gene that allows us to prosper in a manner hugely disproportionate to other people who \\r\\ncontribute as much or more to our society\\'s well-being. Moreover, we have long had jobs that we love, in \\r\\nwhich we are helped every day in countless ways by talented and cheerful associates. No wonder we tap- \\r\\ndance to work. But nothing is more fun for us than getting together with our shareholder-partners at \\r\\nBerkshire\\'s annual meeting. So join us on May 5 th at the Qwest for our annual Woodstock for Capitalists. \\r\\nWe\\'ll see you there. \\r\\n\\r\\nFebruary 28, 2007 Warren E.

In this table, Berkshire\\'s results \\r\\nthrough 1978 have been restated to conform to the changed rules. In all other respects, the results are calculated using \\r\\nthe numbers originally reported. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe S&P 500 numbers are pre-tax whereas the Berkshire numbers are after-tax. If a corporation such as Berkshire \\r\\nwere simply to have owned the S&P 500 and accrued the appropriate taxes, its results would have lagged the S&P 500 \\r\\nin years when that index showed a positive return, but would have exceeded the S&P 500 in years when the index \\r\\nshowed a negative return. Over the years, the tax costs would have caused the aggregate lag to be substantial. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n2 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.: \\r\\n\\r\\nOur gain in net worth during 2009 was $21.8 billion, which increased the per-share book value of both \\r\\nour Class A and Class B stock by 19.8%. Over the last 45 years (that is, since present management took over) \\r\\nbook value has grown from $19 to $84,487, a rate of 20.3% compounded annually.* \\r\\n\\r\\nBerkshire\\'s recent acquisition of Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) has added at least 65,000 \\r\\nshareholders to the 500,000 or so already on our books. It\\'s important to Charlie Munger, my long-time partner, \\r\\nand me that all of our owners understand Berkshire\\'s operations, goals, limitations and culture. In each annual \\r\\nreport, consequently, we restate the economic principles that guide us. This year these principles appear on pages \\r\\n89-94 and I urge all of you - but particularly our new shareholders - to read them. Berkshire has adhered to these \\r\\nprinciples for decades and will continue to do so long after I\\'m gone. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn this letter we will also review some of the basics of our business, hoping to provide both a freshman \\r\\norientation session for our BNSF newcomers and a refresher course for Berkshire veterans. \\r\\n\\r\\nHow We Measure Ourselves \\r\\n\\r\\nOur metrics for evaluating our managerial performance are displayed on the facing page. From the start, \\r\\nCharlie and I have believed in having a rational and unbending standard for measuring what we have - or have \\r\\nnot - accomplished. That keeps us from the temptation of seeing where the arrow of performance lands and then \\r\\npainting the bull\\'s eye around it. \\r\\n\\r\\nSelecting the S&P 500 as our bogey was an easy choice because our shareholders, at virtually no cost, can \\r\\nmatch its performance by holding an index fund. Why should they pay us for merely duplicating that result? \\r\\n\\r\\nA more difficult decision for us was how to measure the progress of Berkshire versus the S&P. There are \\r\\ngood arguments for simply using the change in our stock price. Over an extended period of time, in fact, that is \\r\\nthe best test. But year-to-year market prices can be extraordinarily erratic. Even evaluations covering as long as a \\r\\ndecade can be greatly distorted by foolishly high or low prices at the beginning or end of the measurement \\r\\nperiod. Steve Ballmer, of Microsoft, and Jeff Immelt, of GE, can tell you about that problem, suffering as they do \\r\\nfrom the nosebleed prices at which their stocks traded when they were handed the managerial baton. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe ideal standard for measuring our yearly progress would be the change in Berkshire\\'s per-share intrinsic \\r\\nvalue. Alas, that value cannot be calculated with anything close to precision, so we instead use a crude proxy for \\r\\nit: per-share book value. Relying on this yardstick has its shortcomings, which we discuss on pages 92 and 93. \\r\\nAdditionally, book value at most companies understates intrinsic value, and that is certainly the case at \\r\\nBerkshire. In aggregate, our businesses are worth considerably more than the values at which they are carried on \\r\\nour books. In our all-important insurance business, moreover, the difference is huge. Even so, Charlie and I \\r\\nbelieve that our book value - understated though it is - supplies the most useful tracking device for changes in \\r\\nintrinsic value. By this measurement, as the opening paragraph of this letter states, our book value since the start \\r\\nof fiscal 1965 has grown at a rate of 20.3% compounded annually. \\r\\n\\r\\n*A11 per-share figures used in this report apply to Berkshire\\'s A shares. Figures for the B shares are \\r\\n1/1 500 th of those shown for A. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n3 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWe should note that had we instead chosen market prices as our yardstick, Berkshire\\'s results would \\r\\nlook better, showing a gain since the start of fiscal 1965 of 22% compounded annually. Surprisingly, this modest \\r\\ndifference in annual compounding rate leads to an 801,516% market-value gain for the entire 45-year period \\r\\ncompared to the book-value gain of 434,057% (shown on page 2). Our market gain is better because in 1965 \\r\\nBerkshire shares sold at an appropriate discount to the book value of its underearning textile assets, whereas \\r\\ntoday Berkshire shares regularly sell at a premium to the accounting values of its first-class businesses. \\r\\n\\r\\nSummed up, the table on page 2 conveys three messages, two positive and one hugely negative. First, \\r\\nwe have never had any five-year period beginning with 1965-69 and ending with 2005-09 - and there have been \\r\\n41 of these - during which our gain in book value did not exceed the S&P\\'s gain. Second, though we have lagged \\r\\nthe S&P in some years that were positive for the market, we have consistently done better than the S&P in the \\r\\neleven years during which it delivered negative results. In other words, our defense has been better than our \\r\\noffense, and that\\'s likely to continue. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe big minus is that our performance advantage has shrunk dramatically as our size has grown, an \\r\\nunpleasant trend that is certain to continue. To be sure, Berkshire has many outstanding businesses and a cadre of \\r\\ntruly great managers, operating within an unusual corporate culture that lets them maximize their talents. Charlie \\r\\nand I believe these factors will continue to produce better-than-average results over time. But huge sums forge \\r\\ntheir own anchor and our future advantage, if any, will be a small fraction of our historical edge. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhat We Don\\'t Do \\r\\n\\r\\nLong ago, Charlie laid out his strongest ambition: \"All I want to know is where I\\'m going to die, so I\\'ll \\r\\nnever go there.\" That bit of wisdom was inspired by Jacobi, the great Prussian mathematician, who counseled \\r\\n\"Invert, always invert\" as an aid to solving difficult problems. (I can report as well that this inversion approach \\r\\nworks on a less lofty level: Sing a country song in reverse, and you will quickly recover your car, house and \\r\\nwife.) \\r\\n\\r\\nHere are a few examples of how we apply Charlie\\'s thinking at Berkshire: \\r\\n\\r\\n• Charlie and I avoid businesses whose futures we can\\'t evaluate, no matter how exciting their \\r\\nproducts may be. In the past, it required no brilliance for people to foresee the fabulous growth \\r\\nthat awaited such industries as autos (in 1910), aircraft (in 1930) and television sets (in 1950). But \\r\\nthe future then also included competitive dynamics that would decimate almost all of the \\r\\ncompanies entering those industries. Even the survivors tended to come away bleeding. \\r\\n\\r\\nJust because Charlie and I can clearly see dramatic growth ahead for an industry does not mean \\r\\nwe can judge what its profit margins and returns on capital will be as a host of competitors battle \\r\\nfor supremacy. At Berkshire we will stick with businesses whose profit picture for decades to \\r\\ncome seems reasonably predictable. Even then, we will make plenty of mistakes. \\r\\n\\r\\n• We will never become dependent on the kindness of strangers. Too-big-to-fail is not a fallback \\r\\nposition at Berkshire. Instead, we will always arrange our affairs so that any requirements for cash \\r\\nwe may conceivably have will be dwarfed by our own liquidity. Moreover, that liquidity will be \\r\\nconstantly refreshed by a gusher of earnings from our many and diverse businesses. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the financial system went into cardiac arrest in September 2008, Berkshire was a supplier \\r\\nof liquidity and capital to the system, not a supplicant. At the very peak of the crisis, we poured \\r\\n$15.5 billion into a business world that could otherwise look only to the federal government for \\r\\nhelp. Of that, $9 billion went to bolster capital at three highly-regarded and previously-secure \\r\\nAmerican businesses that needed - without delay - our tangible vote of confidence. The remaining \\r\\n$6.5 billion satisfied our commitment to help fund the purchase of Wrigley, a deal that was \\r\\ncompleted without pause while, elsewhere, panic reigned. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n4 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWe pay a steep price to maintain our premier financial strength. The $20 billion-plus of cash- \\r\\nequivalent assets that we customarily hold is earning a pittance at present. But we sleep well. \\r\\n\\r\\n• We tend to let our many subsidiaries operate on their own, without our supervising and \\r\\nmonitoring them to any degree. That means we are sometimes late in spotting management \\r\\nproblems and that both operating and capital decisions are occasionally made with which Charlie \\r\\nand I would have disagreed had we been consulted. Most of our managers, however, use the \\r\\nindependence we grant them magnificently, rewarding our confidence by maintaining an owner- \\r\\noriented attitude that is invaluable and too seldom found in huge organizations. We would rather \\r\\nsuffer the visible costs of a few bad decisions than incur the many invisible costs that come from \\r\\ndecisions made too slowly - or not at all - because of a stifling bureaucracy. \\r\\n\\r\\nWith our acquisition of BNSF, we now have about 257,000 employees and literally hundreds of \\r\\ndifferent operating units. We hope to have many more of each. But we will never allow Berkshire \\r\\nto become some monolith that is overrun with committees, budget presentations and multiple \\r\\nlayers of management. Instead, we plan to operate as a collection of separately-managed medium- \\r\\nsized and large businesses, most of whose decision-making occurs at the operating level. Charlie \\r\\nand I will limit ourselves to allocating capital, controlling enterprise risk, choosing managers and \\r\\nsetting their compensation. \\r\\n\\r\\n• We make no attempt to woo Wall Street. Investors who buy and sell based upon media or analyst \\r\\ncommentary are not for us. Instead we want partners who join us at Berkshire because they wish \\r\\nto make a long-term investment in a business they themselves understand and because it\\'s one that \\r\\nfollows policies with which they concur. If Charlie and I were to go into a small venture with a \\r\\nfew partners, we would seek individuals in sync with us, knowing that common goals and a shared \\r\\ndestiny make for a happy business \"marriage\" between owners and managers. Scaling up to giant \\r\\nsize doesn\\'t change that truth. \\r\\n\\r\\nTo build a compatible shareholder population, we try to communicate with our owners directly \\r\\nand informatively. Our goal is to tell you what we would like to know if our positions were \\r\\nreversed. Additionally, we try to post our quarterly and annual financial information on the \\r\\nInternet early on weekends, thereby giving you and other investors plenty of time during a \\r\\nnon-trading period to digest just what has happened at our multi-faceted enterprise. (Occasionally, \\r\\nSEC deadlines force a non-Friday disclosure.) These matters simply can\\'t be adequately \\r\\nsummarized in a few paragraphs, nor do they lend themselves to the kind of catchy headline that \\r\\njournalists sometimes seek. \\r\\n\\r\\nLast year we saw, in one instance, how sound-bite reporting can go wrong. Among the 12,830 \\r\\nwords in the annual letter was this sentence: \"We are certain, for example, that the economy will \\r\\nbe in shambles throughout 2009 - and probably well beyond - but that conclusion does not tell us \\r\\nwhether the market will rise or fall.\" Many news organizations reported - indeed, blared - the first \\r\\npart of the sentence while making no mention whatsoever of its ending. I regard this as terrible \\r\\njournalism: Misinformed readers or viewers may well have thought that Charlie and I were \\r\\nforecasting bad things for the stock market, though we had not only in that sentence, but also \\r\\nelsewhere, made it clear we weren\\'t predicting the market at all. Any investors who were misled \\r\\nby the sensationalists paid a big price: The Dow closed the day of the letter at 7,063 and finished \\r\\nthe year at 10,428. \\r\\n\\r\\nGiven a few experiences we\\'ve had like that, you can understand why I prefer that our \\r\\ncommunications with you remain as direct and unabridged as possible. \\r\\n\\r\\nLet\\'s move to the specifics of Berkshire\\'s operations. We have four major operating sectors, each \\r\\ndiffering from the others in balance sheet and income account characteristics. Therefore, lumping them together, \\r\\nas is standard in financial statements, impedes analysis. So we\\'ll present them as four separate businesses, which \\r\\nis how Charlie and I view them. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n5 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nInsurance \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOur property-casualty (P/C) insurance business has been the engine behind Berkshire\\'s growth and will \\r\\ncontinue to be. It has worked wonders for us. We carry our P/C companies on our books at $15.5 billion more \\r\\nthan their net tangible assets, an amount lodged in our \"Goodwill\" account. These companies, however, are \\r\\nworth far more than their carrying value - and the following look at the economic model of the P/C industry will \\r\\ntell you why. \\r\\n\\r\\nInsurers receive premiums upfront and pay claims later. In extreme cases, such as those arising from \\r\\ncertain workers\\' compensation accidents, payments can stretch over decades. This collect-now, pay-later model \\r\\nleaves us holding large sums - money we call \"float\" - that will eventually go to others. Meanwhile, we get to \\r\\ninvest this float for Berkshire\\'s benefit. Though individual policies and claims come and go, the amount of float \\r\\nwe hold remains remarkably stable in relation to premium volume. Consequently, as our business grows, so does \\r\\nour float. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf premiums exceed the total of expenses and eventual losses, we register an underwriting profit that \\r\\nadds to the investment income produced from the float. This combination allows us to enjoy the use of free \\r\\nmoney - and, better yet, get paid for holding it. Alas, the hope of this happy result attracts intense competition, \\r\\nso vigorous in most years as to cause the P/C industry as a whole to operate at a significant underwriting loss. \\r\\nThis loss, in effect, is what the industry pays to hold its float. Usually this cost is fairly low, but in some \\r\\ncatastrophe-ridden years the cost from underwriting losses more than eats up the income derived from use of \\r\\nfloat. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn my perhaps biased view, Berkshire has the best large insurance operation in the world. And I will \\r\\nabsolutely state that we have the best managers. Our float has grown from $16 million in 1967, when we entered \\r\\nthe business, to $62 billion at the end of 2009. Moreover, we have now operated at an underwriting profit for \\r\\nseven consecutive years. I believe it likely that we will continue to underwrite profitably in most - though \\r\\ncertainly not all - future years. If we do so, our float will be cost-free, much as if someone deposited $62 billion \\r\\nwith us that we could invest for our own benefit without the payment of interest. \\r\\n\\r\\nLet me emphasize again that cost-free float is not a result to be expected for the P/C industry as a \\r\\nwhole: In most years, premiums have been inadequate to cover claims plus expenses. Consequently, the \\r\\nindustry\\'s overall return on tangible equity has for many decades fallen far short of that achieved by the S&P \\r\\n500. Outstanding economics exist at Berkshire only because we have some outstanding managers running some \\r\\nunusual businesses. Our insurance CEOs deserve your thanks, having added many billions of dollars to \\r\\nBerkshire\\'s value. It\\'s a pleasure for me to tell you about these all-stars. \\r\\n\\r\\nLet\\'s start at GEICO, which is known to all of you because of its $800 million annual advertising \\r\\nbudget (close to twice that of the runner-up advertiser in the auto insurance field). GEICO is managed by Tony \\r\\nNicely, who joined the company at 18. Now 66, Tony still tap-dances to the office every day, just as I do at 79. \\r\\nWe both feel lucky to work at a business we love. \\r\\n\\r\\nGEICO\\' s customers have warm feelings toward the company as well. Here\\'s proof: Since Berkshire \\r\\nacquired control of GEICO in 1996, its market share has increased from 2.5% to 8.1%, a gain reflecting the net \\r\\naddition of seven million policyholders. Perhaps they contacted us because they thought our gecko was cute, but \\r\\nthey bought from us to save important money. (Maybe you can as well; call 1-800-847-7536 or go to \\r\\nwww.GEICO.com.) And they\\'ve stayed with us because they like our service as well as our price. \\r\\n\\r\\nBerkshire acquired GEICO in two stages. In 1976-80 we bought about one-third of the company\\'s \\r\\nstock for $47 million. Over the years, large repurchases by the company of its own shares caused our position to \\r\\ngrow to about 50% without our having bought any more shares. Then, on January 2, 1996, we acquired the \\r\\nremaining 50% of GEICO for $2.3 billion in cash, about 50 times the cost of our original purchase. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n6 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAn old Wall Street joke gets close to our experience: \\r\\n\\r\\nCustomer: Thanks for putting me in XYZ stock at 5. 1 hear it\\'s up to 18. \\r\\n\\r\\nBroker: Yes, and that\\'s just the beginning. In fact, the company is doing so well now, \\r\\nthat it\\'s an even better buy at 18 than it was when you made your purchase. \\r\\n\\r\\nCustomer: Damn, I knew I should have waited. \\r\\n\\r\\nGEICO\\'s growth may slow in 2010. U.S. vehicle registrations are actually down because of slumping \\r\\nauto sales. Moreover, high unemployment is causing a growing number of drivers to go uninsured. (That\\'s illegal \\r\\nalmost everywhere, but if you\\'ve lost your job and still want to drive . . .) Our \"low-cost producer\" status, \\r\\nhowever, is sure to give us significant gains in the future. In 1995, GEICO was the country\\'s sixth largest auto \\r\\ninsurer; now we are number three. The company\\'s float has grown from $2.7 billion to $9.6 billion. Equally \\r\\nimportant, GEICO has operated at an underwriting profit in 13 of the 14 years Berkshire has owned it. \\r\\n\\r\\nI became excited about GEICO in January 1951, when I first visited the company as a 20-year-old \\r\\nstudent. Thanks to Tony, I\\'m even more excited today. \\r\\n\\r\\nA hugely important event in Berkshire\\'s history occurred on a Saturday in 1985. Ajit Jain came into \\r\\nour office in Omaha - and I immediately knew we had found a superstar. (He had been discovered by Mike \\r\\nGoldberg, now elevated to St. Mike.) \\r\\n\\r\\nWe immediately put Ajit in charge of National Indemnity\\'s small and struggling reinsurance operation. \\r\\nOver the years, he has built this business into a one-of-a-kind giant in the insurance world. \\r\\n\\r\\nStaffed today by only 30 people, Ajit\\'s operation has set records for transaction size in several areas of \\r\\ninsurance. Ajit writes billion-dollar limits - and then keeps every dime of the risk instead of laying it off with \\r\\nother insurers. Three years ago, he took over huge liabilities from Lloyds, allowing it to clean up its relationship \\r\\nwith 27,972 participants (\"names\") who had written problem-ridden policies that at one point threatened the \\r\\nsurvival of this 322-year-old institution. The premium for that single contract was $7.1 billion. During 2009, he \\r\\nnegotiated a life reinsurance contract that could produce $50 billion of premium for us over the next 50 or so \\r\\nyears. \\r\\n\\r\\nAjit\\'s business is just the opposite of GEICO\\'s. At that company, we have millions of small policies \\r\\nthat largely renew year after year. Ajit writes relatively few policies, and the mix changes significantly from year \\r\\nto year. Throughout the world, he is known as the man to call when something both very large and unusual needs \\r\\nto be insured. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf Charlie, I and Ajit are ever in a sinking boat - and you can only save one of us - swim to Ajit. \\r\\n\\r\\nOur third insurance powerhouse is General Re. Some years back this operation was troubled; now it is \\r\\na gleaming jewel in our insurance crown. \\r\\n\\r\\nUnder the leadership of Tad Montross, General Re had an outstanding underwriting year in 2009, while \\r\\nalso delivering us unusually large amounts of float per dollar of premium volume. Alongside General Re\\'s P/C \\r\\nbusiness, Tad and his associates have developed a major life reinsurance operation that has grown increasingly \\r\\nvaluable. \\r\\n\\r\\nLast year General Re finally attained 100% ownership of Cologne Re, which since 1995 has been a \\r\\nkey - though only partially-owned - part of our presence around the world. Tad and I will be visiting Cologne in \\r\\nSeptember to thank its managers for their important contribution to Berkshire. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n7 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, we own a group of smaller companies, most of them specializing in odd corners of the \\r\\ninsurance world. In aggregate, their results have consistently been profitable and, as the table below shows, the \\r\\nfloat they provide us is substantial. Charlie and I treasure these companies and their managers. \\r\\n\\r\\nHere is the record of all four segments of our property-casualty and life insurance businesses: \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nUnderwriting Profit Yearend Float \\r\\n(in millions) \\r\\n\\r\\nInsurance Operations 2009 2008 2009 2008 \\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral Re $ 477 $ 342 $21,014 $21,074 \\r\\n\\r\\nBH Reinsurance 349 1,324 26,223 24,221 \\r\\n\\r\\nGEICO 649 916 9,613 8,454 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther Primary 84 210 5,061 4,739 \\r\\n\\r\\n$1,559 $2,792 $61,911 $58,488 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd now a painful confession: Last year your chairman closed the book on a very expensive business \\r\\nfiasco entirely of his own making. \\r\\n\\r\\nFor many years I had struggled to think of side products that we could offer our millions of loyal \\r\\nGEICO customers. Unfortunately, I finally succeeded, coming up with a brilliant insight that we should market \\r\\nour own credit card. I reasoned that GEICO policyholders were likely to be good credit risks and, assuming we \\r\\noffered an attractive card, would likely favor us with their business. We got business all right - but of the wrong \\r\\ntype. \\r\\n\\r\\nOur pre-tax losses from credit-card operations came to about $6.3 million before I finally woke up. We \\r\\nthen sold our $98 million portfolio of troubled receivables for 550 on the dollar, losing an additional $44 million. \\r\\n\\r\\nGEICO\\' s managers, it should be emphasized, were never enthusiastic about my idea. They warned me \\r\\n\\r\\nthat instead of getting the cream of GEICO\\' s customers we would get the well, let\\'s call it the \\r\\n\\r\\nnon-cream. I subtly indicated that I was older and wiser. \\r\\n\\r\\nI was just older. \\r\\n\\r\\nRegulated Utility Business \\r\\n\\r\\nBerkshire has an 89.5% interest in MidAmerican Energy Holdings, which owns a wide variety of \\r\\nutility operations. The largest of these are (1) Yorkshire Electricity and Northern Electric, whose 3.8 million end \\r\\nusers make it the U.K.\\'s third largest distributor of electricity; (2) MidAmerican Energy, which serves 725,000 \\r\\nelectric customers, primarily in Iowa; (3) Pacific Power and Rocky Mountain Power, serving about 1.7 million \\r\\nelectric customers in six western states; and (4) Kern River and Northern Natural pipelines, which carry about \\r\\n8% of the natural gas consumed in the U.S. \\r\\n\\r\\nMidAmerican has two terrific managers, Dave Sokol and Greg Abel. In addition, my long-time friend, \\r\\nWalter Scott, along with his family, has a major ownership position in the company. Walter brings extraordinary \\r\\nbusiness savvy to any operation. Ten years of working with Dave, Greg and Walter have reinforced my original \\r\\nbelief: Berkshire couldn\\'t have better partners. They are truly a dream team. \\r\\n\\r\\nSomewhat incongruously, MidAmerican also owns the second largest real estate brokerage firm in the \\r\\nU.S., HomeServices of America. This company operates through 21 locally-branded firms that have 16,000 \\r\\nagents. Though last year was again a terrible year for home sales, HomeServices earned a modest sum. It also \\r\\nacquired a firm in Chicago and will add other quality brokerage operations when they are available at sensible \\r\\nprices. A decade from now, HomeServices is likely to be much larger. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n8 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHere are some key figures on MidAmerican\\' s operations: \\r\\n\\r\\nEarnings ( in millions ) \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n2009 2008 \\r\\n\\r\\nU.K. utilities $ 248 $ 339 \\r\\n\\r\\nIowa utility 285 425 \\r\\n\\r\\nWestern utilities 788 703 \\r\\n\\r\\nPipelines 457 595 \\r\\n\\r\\nHomeServices 43 (45) \\r\\n\\r\\nOther (net) 25 186 \\r\\n\\r\\nOperating earnings before corporate interest and taxes 1,846 2,203 \\r\\n\\r\\nConstellation Energy * — 1,092 \\r\\n\\r\\nInterest, other than to Berkshire (318) (332) \\r\\n\\r\\nInterest on Berkshire junior debt (58) (HI) \\r\\n\\r\\nIncome tax (313) (1,002) \\r\\n\\r\\nNet earnings $1,157 $1,850 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEarnings applicable to Berkshire ** $ 1,071 $ 1,704 \\r\\n\\r\\nDebt owed to others 19,579 19,145 \\r\\n\\r\\nDebt owed to Berkshire 353 1,087 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n♦Consists of a breakup fee of $175 million and a profit on our investment of $917 million. \\r\\n**Includes interest earned by Berkshire (net of related income taxes) of $38 in 2009 and $72 in 2008. \\r\\n\\r\\nOur regulated electric utilities, offering monopoly service in most cases, operate in a symbiotic manner \\r\\nwith the customers in their service areas, with those users depending on us to provide first-class service and \\r\\ninvest for their future needs. Permitting and construction periods for generation and major transmission facilities \\r\\nstretch way out, so it is incumbent on us to be far-sighted. We, in turn, look to our utilities\\' regulators (acting on \\r\\nbehalf of our customers) to allow us an appropriate return on the huge amounts of capital we must deploy to meet \\r\\nfuture needs. We shouldn\\'t expect our regulators to live up to their end of the bargain unless we live up to ours. \\r\\n\\r\\nDave and Greg make sure we do just that. National research companies consistently rank our Iowa and \\r\\nWestern utilities at or near the top of their industry. Similarly, among the 43 U.S. pipelines ranked by a firm \\r\\nnamed Mastio, our Kern River and Northern Natural properties tied for second place. \\r\\n\\r\\nMoreover, we continue to pour huge sums of money into our operations so as to not only prepare for \\r\\nthe future but also make these operations more environmentally friendly. Since we purchased MidAmerican ten \\r\\nyears ago, it has never paid a dividend. We have instead used earnings to improve and expand our properties in \\r\\neach of the territories we serve. As one dramatic example, in the last three years our Iowa and Western utilities \\r\\nhave earned $2.5 billion, while in this same period spending $3 billion on wind generation facilities. \\r\\n\\r\\nMidAmerican has consistently kept its end of the bargain with society and, to society\\'s credit, it has \\r\\nreciprocated: With few exceptions, our regulators have promptly allowed us to earn a fair return on the ever- \\r\\nincreasing sums of capital we must invest. Going forward, we will do whatever it takes to serve our territories in \\r\\nthe manner they expect. We believe that, in turn, we will be allowed the return we deserve on the funds we \\r\\ninvest. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn earlier days, Charlie and I shunned capital-intensive businesses such as public utilities. Indeed, the \\r\\nbest businesses by far for owners continue to be those that have high returns on capital and that require little \\r\\nincremental investment to grow. We are fortunate to own a number of such businesses, and we would love to buy \\r\\nmore. Anticipating, however, that Berkshire will generate ever-increasing amounts of cash, we are today quite \\r\\nwilling to enter businesses that regularly require large capital expenditures. We expect only that these businesses \\r\\nhave reasonable expectations of earning decent returns on the incremental sums they invest. If our expectations \\r\\nare met - and we believe that they will be - Berkshire\\'s ever-growing collection of good to great businesses \\r\\nshould produce above-average, though certainly not spectacular, returns in the decades ahead. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n9 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOur BNSF operation, it should be noted, has certain important economic characteristics that resemble \\r\\nthose of our electric utilities. In both cases we provide fundamental services that are, and will remain, essential to \\r\\nthe economic well-being of our customers, the communities we serve, and indeed the nation. Both will require \\r\\nheavy investment that greatly exceeds depreciation allowances for decades to come. Both must also plan far \\r\\nahead to satisfy demand that is expected to outstrip the needs of the past. Finally, both require wise regulators \\r\\nwho will provide certainty about allowable returns so that we can confidently make the huge investments \\r\\nrequired to maintain, replace and expand the plant. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe see a \"social compact\" existing between the public and our railroad business, just as is the case \\r\\nwith our utilities. If either side shirks its obligations, both sides will inevitably suffer. Therefore, both parties to \\r\\nthe compact should - and we believe will - understand the benefit of behaving in a way that encourages good \\r\\nbehavior by the other. It is inconceivable that our country will realize anything close to its full economic \\r\\npotential without its possessing first-class electricity and railroad systems. We will do our part to see that they \\r\\nexist. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the future, BNSF results will be included in this \"regulated utility\" section. Aside from the two \\r\\nbusinesses having similar underlying economic characteristics, both are logical users of substantial amounts of \\r\\ndebt that is not guaranteed by Berkshire. Both will retain most of their earnings. Both will earn and invest large \\r\\nsums in good times or bad, though the railroad will display the greater cyclically. Overall, we expect this \\r\\nregulated sector to deliver significantly increased earnings over time, albeit at the cost of our investing many tens \\r\\n- yes, tens - of billions of dollars of incremental equity capital. \\r\\n\\r\\nManufacturing, Service and Retailing Operations \\r\\n\\r\\nOur activities in this part of Berkshire cover the waterfront. Let\\'s look, though, at a summary balance \\r\\nsheet and earnings statement for the entire group. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBalance Sheet \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAssets \\r\\n\\r\\nCash and equivalents $ 3,018 \\r\\n\\r\\nAccounts and notes receivable 5,066 \\r\\n\\r\\nInventory 6,147 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther current assets 625 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal current assets 14,856 \\r\\n\\r\\nGoodwill and other intangibles 1 6,499 \\r\\n\\r\\nFixed assets 15,374 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther assets 2,070 \\r\\n\\r\\n$48,799 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n(in millions) \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLiabilities and Equity \\r\\n\\r\\nNotes payable $ 1,842 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther current liabilities 7,414 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal current liabilities 9,256 \\r\\n\\r\\nDeferred taxes 2,834 \\r\\n\\r\\nTerm debt and other liabilities 6,240 \\r\\n\\r\\nEquity 30,469 \\r\\n\\r\\n$48,799 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEarnings Statement ( in millions ) \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n2009 2008 2007 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRevenues $61,665 $66,099 $59,100 \\r\\n\\r\\nOperating expenses (including depreciation of $1,422 in 2009, $1,280 in 2008 \\r\\n\\r\\nand $955 in 2007) 59,509 61,937 55,026 \\r\\n\\r\\nInterest expense 98 139 127 \\r\\n\\r\\nPre-tax earnings 2,058* 4,023* 3,947* \\r\\n\\r\\nIncome taxes and minority interests 945 1,740 1,594 \\r\\n\\r\\nNet income $ 1,113 $ 2,283 $ 2,353 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*Does not include purchase-accounting adjustments. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n10 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAlmost all of the many and widely-diverse operations in this sector suffered to one degree or another \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nfrom 2009\\' s severe recession. The major exception was McLane, our distributor of groceries, confections and \\r\\nnon-food items to thousands of retail outlets, the largest by far Wal-Mart. \\r\\n\\r\\nGrady Rosier led McLane to record pre-tax earnings of $344 million, which even so amounted to only \\r\\nslightly more than one cent per dollar on its huge sales of $31.2 billion. McLane employs a vast array of physical \\r\\nassets - practically all of which it owns - including 3,242 trailers, 2,309 tractors and 55 distribution centers with \\r\\n15.2 million square feet of space. McLane\\' s prime asset, however, is Grady. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe had a number of companies at which profits improved even as sales contracted, always an \\r\\nexceptional managerial achievement. Here are the CEOs who made it happen: \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong the businesses we own that have major exposure to the depressed industrial sector, both \\r\\nMarmon and Iscar turned in relatively strong performances. Frank Ptak\\'s Marmon delivered a 13.5% pre-tax \\r\\nprofit margin, a record high. Though the company\\'s sales were down 27%, Frank\\'s cost-conscious management \\r\\nmitigated the decline in earnings. \\r\\n\\r\\nNothing stops Israel-based Iscar - not wars, recessions or competitors. The world\\'s two other leading \\r\\nsuppliers of small cutting tools both had very difficult years, each operating at a loss throughout much of the \\r\\nyear. Though Iscar\\' s results were down significantly from 2008, the company regularly reported profits, even \\r\\nwhile it was integrating and rationalizing Tungaloy, the large Japanese acquisition that we told you about last \\r\\nyear. When manufacturing rebounds, Iscar will set new records. Its incredible managerial team of Eitan \\r\\nWertheimer, Jacob Harpaz and Danny Goldman will see to that. \\r\\n\\r\\nEvery business we own that is connected to residential and commercial construction suffered severely \\r\\nin 2009. Combined pre-tax earnings of Shaw, Johns Manville, Acme Brick, and MiTek were $227 million, an \\r\\n82.5% decline from $1,295 billion in 2006, when construction activity was booming. These businesses continue \\r\\nto bump along the bottom, though their competitive positions remain undented. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe major problem for Berkshire last year was NetJets, an aviation operation that offers fractional \\r\\nownership of jets. Over the years, it has been enormously successful in establishing itself as the premier company \\r\\nin its industry, with the value of its fleet far exceeding that of its three major competitors combined. Overall, our \\r\\ndominance in the field remains unchallenged. \\r\\n\\r\\nNetJets\\' business operation, however, has been another story. In the eleven years that we have owned \\r\\nthe company, it has recorded an aggregate pre-tax loss of $157 million. Moreover, the company\\'s debt has soared \\r\\nfrom $102 million at the time of purchase to $1.9 billion in April of last year. Without Berkshire\\'s guarantee of \\r\\nthis debt, NetJets would have been out of business. It\\'s clear that I failed you in letting NetJets descend into this \\r\\ncondition.

His leadership has been transforming: Debt has already been reduced to $1.4 billion, and, after \\r\\nsuffering a staggering loss of $71 1 million in 2009, the company is now solidly profitable. \\r\\n\\r\\nMost important, none of the changes wrought by Dave have in any way undercut the top-of-the-line \\r\\nstandards for safety and service that Rich Santulli, NetJets\\' previous CEO and the father of the fractional- \\r\\nownership industry, insisted upon. Dave and I have the strongest possible personal interest in maintaining these \\r\\nstandards because we and our families use NetJets for almost all of our flying, as do many of our directors and \\r\\nmanagers. None of us are assigned special planes nor crews. We receive exactly the same treatment as any other \\r\\nowner, meaning we pay the same prices as everyone else does when we are using our personal contracts. In short, \\r\\nwe eat our own cooking. In the aviation business, no other testimonial means more. \\r\\n\\r\\nFinance and Financial Products \\r\\n\\r\\nOur largest operation in this sector is Clayton Homes, the country\\'s leading producer of modular and \\r\\nmanufactured homes. Clayton was not always number one: A decade ago the three leading manufacturers were \\r\\nFleetwood, Champion and Oakwood, which together accounted for 44% of the output of the industry. All have \\r\\nsince gone bankrupt. Total industry output, meanwhile, has fallen from 382,000 units in 1999 to 60,000 units in \\r\\n2009. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe industry is in shambles for two reasons, the first of which must be lived with if the U.S. economy \\r\\nis to recover. This reason concerns U.S. housing starts (including apartment units). In 2009, starts were 554,000, \\r\\nby far the lowest number in the 50 years for which we have data. Paradoxically, this is good news. \\r\\n\\r\\nPeople thought it was good news a few years back when housing starts - the supply side of the picture \\r\\n- were running about two million annually. But household formations - the demand side - only amounted to \\r\\nabout 1.2 million. After a few years of such imbalances, the country unsurprisingly ended up with far too many \\r\\nhouses. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere were three ways to cure this overhang: (1) blow up a lot of houses, a tactic similar to the \\r\\ndestruction of autos that occurred with the \"cash-for-clunkers\" program; (2) speed up household formations by, \\r\\nsay, encouraging teenagers to cohabitate, a program not likely to suffer from a lack of volunteers or; (3) reduce \\r\\nnew housing starts to a number far below the rate of household formations. \\r\\n\\r\\nOur country has wisely selected the third option, which means that within a year or so residential \\r\\nhousing problems should largely be behind us, the exceptions being only high-value houses and those in certain \\r\\nlocalities where overbuilding was particularly egregious. Prices will remain far below \"bubble\" levels, of course, \\r\\nbut for every seller (or lender) hurt by this there will be a buyer who benefits. Indeed, many families that couldn\\'t \\r\\nafford to buy an appropriate home a few years ago now find it well within their means because the bubble burst. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe second reason that manufactured housing is troubled is specific to the industry: the punitive \\r\\ndifferential in mortgage rates between factory-built homes and site-built homes. Before you read further, let me \\r\\nunderscore the obvious: Berkshire has a dog in this fight, and you should therefore assess the commentary that \\r\\nfollows with special care. That warning made, however, let me explain why the rate differential causes problems \\r\\nfor both large numbers of lower-income Americans and Clayton. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe residential mortgage market is shaped by government rules that are expressed by FHA, Freddie \\r\\nMac and Fannie Mae. Their lending standards are all-powerful because the mortgages they insure can typically \\r\\nbe securitized and turned into what, in effect, is an obligation of the U.S. government. Currently buyers of \\r\\nconventional site-built homes who qualify for these guarantees can obtain a 30-year loan at about 5 14%. In \\r\\naddition, these are mortgages that have recently been purchased in massive amounts by the Federal Reserve, an \\r\\naction that also helped to keep rates at bargain-basement levels. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn contrast, very few factory-built homes qualify for agency-insured mortgages. Therefore, a \\r\\nmeritorious buyer of a factory-built home must pay about 9% on his loan. For the all-cash buyer, Clayton\\'s \\r\\nhomes offer terrific value. If the buyer needs mortgage financing, however - and, of course, most buyers do - the \\r\\ndifference in financing costs too often negates the attractive price of a factory-built home. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n12 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLast year I told you why our buyers - generally people with low incomes - performed so well as credit \\r\\nrisks. Their attitude was all-important: They signed up to live in the home, not resell or refinance it. \\r\\nConsequently, our buyers usually took out loans with payments geared to their verified incomes (we weren\\'t \\r\\nmaking \"liar\\'s loans\") and looked forward to the day they could burn their mortgage. If they lost their jobs, had \\r\\nhealth problems or got divorced, we could of course expect defaults. But they seldom walked away simply \\r\\nbecause house values had fallen. Even today, though job-loss troubles have grown, Clayton\\'s delinquencies and \\r\\ndefaults remain reasonable and will not cause us significant problems. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe have tried to qualify more of our customers\\' loans for treatment similar to those available on the \\r\\nsite-built product. So far we have had only token success. Many families with modest incomes but responsible \\r\\nhabits have therefore had to forego home ownership simply because the financing differential attached to the \\r\\nfactory -built product makes monthly payments too expensive. If qualifications aren\\'t broadened, so as to open \\r\\nlow-cost financing to all who meet down-payment and income standards, the manufactured-home industry seems \\r\\ndestined to struggle and dwindle. \\r\\n\\r\\nEven under these conditions, I believe Clayton will operate profitably in coming years, though well \\r\\nbelow its potential. We couldn\\'t have a better manager than CEO Kevin Clayton, who treats Berkshire\\'s interests \\r\\nas if they were his own. Our product is first-class, inexpensive and constantly being improved. Moreover, we will \\r\\ncontinue to use Berkshire\\'s credit to support Clayton\\'s mortgage program, convinced as we are of its soundness. \\r\\nEven so, Berkshire can\\'t borrow at a rate approaching that available to government agencies. This handicap will \\r\\nlimit sales, hurting both Clayton and a multitude of worthy families who long for a low-cost home. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the following table, Clayton\\'s earnings are net of the company\\'s payment to Berkshire for the use of \\r\\nits credit. Offsetting this cost to Clayton is an identical amount of income credited to Berkshire\\'s finance \\r\\noperation and included in \"Other Income.\" The cost and income amount was $116 million in 2009 and $92 \\r\\nmillion in 2008. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe table also illustrates how severely our furniture (CORT) and trailer (XTRA) leasing operations \\r\\nhave been hit by the recession. Though their competitive positions remain as strong as ever, we have yet to see \\r\\nany bounce in these businesses. \\r\\n\\r\\nPre-Tax Earnings \\r\\n\\r\\n(in millions) \\r\\n2009 2008 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNet investment income $278 $330 \\r\\n\\r\\nLife and annuity operation 116 23 \\r\\n\\r\\nLeasing operations 14 87 \\r\\n\\r\\nManufactured-housing finance (Clayton) 187 206 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther income * 186 141 \\r\\n\\r\\nIncome before investment and derivatives gains or losses $781 $787 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n^\\'Includes $116 million in 2009 and $92 million in 2008 of fees that Berkshire charges Clayton for the \\r\\nuse of Berkshire\\'s credit. \\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of 2009, we became a 50% owner of Berkadia Commercial Mortgage (formerly known as \\r\\nCapmark), the country\\'s third-largest servicer of commercial mortgages. In addition to servicing a $235 billion \\r\\nportfolio, the company is an important originator of mortgages, having 25 offices spread around the country. \\r\\nThough commercial real estate will face major problems in the next few years, long-term opportunities for \\r\\nBerkadia are significant. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n13 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOur partner in this operation is Leucadia, run by Joe Steinberg and Ian Cumming, with whom we had a \\r\\nterrific experience some years back when Berkshire joined with them to purchase Finova, a troubled finance \\r\\nbusiness. In resolving that situation, Joe and Ian did far more than their share of the work, an arrangement I \\r\\nalways encourage. Naturally, I was delighted when they called me to partner again in the Capmark purchase. \\r\\n\\r\\nOur first venture was also christened Berkadia. So let\\'s call this one Son of Berkadia. Someday I\\'ll be \\r\\nwriting you about Grandson of Berkadia. \\r\\n\\r\\nInvestments \\r\\n\\r\\nBelow we show our common stock investments that at yearend had a market value of more than $1 billion. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n12/31/09 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nShares \\r\\n\\r\\nCompany \\r\\n\\r\\nPercentage of \\r\\nCompany \\r\\nOwned \\r\\n\\r\\nCost * \\r\\n\\r\\nMarket \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n( in mi \\r\\n\\r\\nUlions) \\r\\n\\r\\n151,610,700 \\r\\n\\r\\nAmerican Express Company \\r\\n\\r\\n12.7 \\r\\n\\r\\n$ 1,287 \\r\\n\\r\\n$ 6,143 \\r\\n\\r\\n225,000,000 \\r\\n\\r\\nBYD Company, Ltd \\r\\n\\r\\n9.9 \\r\\n\\r\\n232 \\r\\n\\r\\n1,986 \\r\\n\\r\\n200,000,000 \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Coca-Cola Company \\r\\n\\r\\n8.6 \\r\\n\\r\\n1,299 \\r\\n\\r\\n11,400 \\r\\n\\r\\n37,711,330 \\r\\n\\r\\nConocoPhillips \\r\\n\\r\\n2.5 \\r\\n\\r\\n2,741 \\r\\n\\r\\n1,926 \\r\\n\\r\\n28,530,467 \\r\\n\\r\\nJohnson & Johnson \\r\\n\\r\\n1.0 \\r\\n\\r\\n1,724 \\r\\n\\r\\n1,838 \\r\\n\\r\\n130,272,500 \\r\\n\\r\\nKraft Foods Inc \\r\\n\\r\\n8.8 \\r\\n\\r\\n4,330 \\r\\n\\r\\n3,541 \\r\\n\\r\\n3,947,554 \\r\\n\\r\\nPOSCO \\r\\n\\r\\n5.2 \\r\\n\\r\\n768 \\r\\n\\r\\n2,092 \\r\\n\\r\\n83,128,411 \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Procter & Gamble Company \\r\\n\\r\\n2.9 \\r\\n\\r\\n533 \\r\\n\\r\\n5,040 \\r\\n\\r\\n25,108,967 \\r\\n\\r\\nSanofi-Aventis \\r\\n\\r\\n1.9 \\r\\n\\r\\n2,027 \\r\\n\\r\\n1,979 \\r\\n\\r\\n234,247,373 \\r\\n\\r\\nTesco pic \\r\\n\\r\\n3.0 \\r\\n\\r\\n1,367 \\r\\n\\r\\n1,620 \\r\\n\\r\\n76,633,426 \\r\\n\\r\\nU.S. Bancorp \\r\\n\\r\\n4.0 \\r\\n\\r\\n2,371 \\r\\n\\r\\n1,725 \\r\\n\\r\\n39,037,142 \\r\\n\\r\\nWal-Mart Stores, Inc \\r\\n\\r\\n1.0 \\r\\n\\r\\n1,893 \\r\\n\\r\\n2,087 \\r\\n\\r\\n334,235,585 \\r\\n\\r\\nWells Fargo & Company \\r\\n\\r\\n6.5 \\r\\n\\r\\n7,394 \\r\\n\\r\\n9,021 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOthers \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n6,680 \\r\\n\\r\\n8,636 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTotal Common Stocks Carried at Market \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n$34,646 \\r\\n\\r\\n$59,034 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*This is our actual purchase price and also our tax basis; GAAP \"cost\" differs in a few cases because of \\r\\nwrite-ups or write-downs that have been required. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition, we own positions in non-traded securities of Dow Chemical, General Electric, Goldman \\r\\nSachs, Swiss Re and Wrigley with an aggregate cost of $21.1 billion and a carrying value of $26.0 billion. We \\r\\npurchased these five positions in the last 18 months. Setting aside the significant equity potential they provide us, \\r\\nthese holdings deliver us an aggregate of $2.1 billion annually in dividends and interest. Finally, we owned \\r\\n76,777,029 shares (22.5%) of BNSF at yearend, which we then carried at $85.78 per share, but which have \\r\\nsubsequently been melded into our purchase of the entire company. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2009, our largest sales were in ConocoPhillips, Moody\\'s, Procter & Gamble and Johnson & Johnson \\r\\n(sales of the latter occurring after we had built our position earlier in the year). Charlie and I believe that all of \\r\\nthese stocks will likely trade higher in the future. We made some sales early in 2009 to raise cash for our Dow \\r\\nand Swiss Re purchases and late in the year made other sales in anticipation of our BNSF purchase. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n14 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWe told you last year that very unusual conditions then existed in the corporate and municipal bond \\r\\nmarkets and that these securities were ridiculously cheap relative to U.S. Treasuries. We backed this view with \\r\\nsome purchases, but I should have done far more. Big opportunities come infrequently. When it\\'s raining gold, \\r\\nreach for a bucket, not a thimble. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe entered 2008 with $44.3 billion of cash-equivalents, and we have since retained operating earnings \\r\\nof $17 billion. Nevertheless, at yearend 2009, our cash was down to $30.6 billion (with $8 billion earmarked for \\r\\nthe BNSF acquisition). We\\'ve put a lot of money to work during the chaos of the last two years. It\\'s been an \\r\\nideal period for investors: A climate of fear is their best friend. Those who invest only when commentators are \\r\\nupbeat end up paying a heavy price for meaningless reassurance. In the end, what counts in investing is what you \\r\\npay for a business - through the purchase of a small piece of it in the stock market - and what that business earns \\r\\nin the succeeding decade or two. \\r\\n\\r\\nLast year I wrote extensively about our derivatives contracts, which were then the subject of both \\r\\ncontroversy and misunderstanding. For that discussion, please go to www.berkshirehathaway.com. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe have since changed only a few of our positions. Some credit contracts have run off. The terms of \\r\\nabout 10% of our equity put contracts have also changed: Maturities have been shortened and strike prices \\r\\nmaterially reduced. In these modifications, no money changed hands. \\r\\n\\r\\nA few points from last year\\'s discussion are worth repeating: \\r\\n\\r\\n(1) Though it\\'s no sure thing, I expect our contracts in aggregate to deliver us a profit over their lifetime, \\r\\neven when investment income on the huge amount of float they provide us is excluded in the \\r\\ncalculation. Our derivatives float - which is not included in the $62 billion of insurance float I \\r\\ndescribed earlier - was about $6.3 billion at yearend. \\r\\n\\r\\n(2) Only a handful of our contracts require us to post collateral under any circumstances. At last year\\'s low \\r\\npoint in the stock and credit markets, our posting requirement was $1.7 billion, a small fraction of the \\r\\nderivatives-related float we held. When we do post collateral, let me add, the securities we put up \\r\\ncontinue to earn money for our account. \\r\\n\\r\\n(3) Finally, you should expect large swings in the carrying value of these contracts, items that can affect \\r\\nour reported quarterly earnings in a huge way but that do not affect our cash or investment holdings. \\r\\nThat thought certainly fit 2009\\' s circumstances. Here are the pre-tax quarterly gains and losses from \\r\\nderivatives valuations that were part of our reported earnings last year: \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nQuarter $ Gain (Loss) in Billions \\r\\n\\r\\n1 (1.517) \\r\\n\\r\\n2 2.357 \\r\\n\\r\\n3 1.732 \\r\\n\\r\\n4 1.052 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAs we\\'ve explained, these wild swings neither cheer nor bother Charlie and me. When we report to \\r\\nyou, we will continue to separate out these figures (as we do realized investment gains and losses) so that you can \\r\\nmore clearly view the earnings of our operating businesses. We are delighted that we hold the derivatives \\r\\ncontracts that we do. To date we have significantly profited from the float they provide. We expect also to earn \\r\\nfurther investment income over the life of our contracts. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n15 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have long invested in derivatives contracts that Charlie and I think are mispriced, just as we try to \\r\\ninvest in mispriced stocks and bonds. Indeed, we first reported to you that we held such contracts in early 1998. \\r\\nThe dangers that derivatives pose for both participants and society - dangers of which we\\'ve long warned, and \\r\\nthat can be dynamite - arise when these contracts lead to leverage and/or counterparty risk that is extreme. At \\r\\nBerkshire nothing like that has occurred - nor will it. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\'s my job to keep Berkshire far away from such problems. Charlie and I believe that a CEO must not \\r\\ndelegate risk control. It\\'s simply too important. At Berkshire, I both initiate and monitor every derivatives \\r\\ncontract on our books, with the exception of operations-related contracts at a few of our subsidiaries, such as \\r\\nMidAmerican, and the minor runoff contracts at General Re. If Berkshire ever gets in trouble, it will be my fault. \\r\\nIt will not be because of misjudgments made by a Risk Committee or Chief Risk Officer. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn my view a board of directors of a huge financial institution is derelict if it does not insist that its \\r\\nCEO bear full responsibility for risk control. If he\\'s incapable of handling that job, he should look for other \\r\\nemployment. And if he fails at it - with the government thereupon required to step in with funds or guarantees - \\r\\nthe financial consequences for him and his board should be severe. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt has not been shareholders who have botched the operations of some of our country\\'s largest financial \\r\\ninstitutions. Yet they have borne the burden, with 90% or more of the value of their holdings wiped out in most \\r\\ncases of failure. Collectively, they have lost more than $500 billion in just the four largest financial fiascos of the \\r\\nlast two years. To say these owners have been \"bailed-out\" is to make a mockery of the term. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe CEOs and directors of the failed companies, however, have largely gone unscathed. Their fortunes may \\r\\nhave been diminished by the disasters they oversaw, but they still live in grand style. It is the behavior of these \\r\\nCEOs and directors that needs to be changed: If their institutions and the country are harmed by their \\r\\nrecklessness, they should pay a heavy price - one not reimbursable by the companies they\\'ve damaged nor by \\r\\ninsurance. CEOs and, in many cases, directors have long benefitted from oversized financial carrots; some \\r\\nmeaningful sticks now need to be part of their employment picture as well. \\r\\n\\r\\nAn Inconvenient Truth (Boardroom Overheating) \\r\\n\\r\\nOur subsidiaries made a few small \"bolt-on\" acquisitions last year for cash, but our blockbuster deal \\r\\nwith BNSF required us to issue about 95,000 Berkshire shares that amounted to 6.1% of those previously \\r\\noutstanding. Charlie and I enjoy issuing Berkshire stock about as much as we relish prepping for a colonoscopy. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe reason for our distaste is simple. If we wouldn\\'t dream of selling Berkshire in its entirety at the \\r\\ncurrent market price, why in the world should we \"sell\" a significant part of the company at that same inadequate \\r\\nprice by issuing our stock in a merger? \\r\\n\\r\\nIn evaluating a stock-for-stock offer, shareholders of the target company quite understandably focus on \\r\\nthe market price of the acquirer\\'s shares that are to be given them. But they also expect the transaction to deliver \\r\\nthem the intrinsic value of their own shares - the ones they are giving up. If shares of a prospective acquirer are \\r\\nselling below their intrinsic value, it\\'s impossible for that buyer to make a sensible deal in an all-stock deal. You \\r\\nsimply can\\'t exchange an undervalued stock for a fully-valued one without hurting your shareholders. \\r\\n\\r\\nImagine, if you will, Company A and Company B, of equal size and both with businesses intrinsically \\r\\nworth $100 per share. Both of their stocks, however, sell for $80 per share. The CEO of A, long on confidence \\r\\nand short on smarts, offers 1 Va shares of A for each share of B, correctly telling his directors that B is worth $100 \\r\\nper share. He will neglect to explain, though, that what he is giving will cost his shareholders $125 in intrinsic \\r\\nvalue. If the directors are mathematically challenged as well, and a deal is therefore completed, the shareholders \\r\\nof B will end up owning 55.6% of A & B\\'s combined assets and A\\'s shareholders will own 44.4%. Not everyone \\r\\nat A, it should be noted, is a loser from this nonsensical transaction. Its CEO now runs a company twice as large \\r\\nas his original domain, in a world where size tends to correlate with both prestige and compensation. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n16 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIf an acquirer\\'s stock is overvalued, it\\'s a different story: Using it as a currency works to the acquirer\\'s \\r\\nadvantage. That\\'s why bubbles in various areas of the stock market have invariably led to serial issuances of \\r\\nstock by sly promoters. Going by the market value of their stock, they can afford to overpay because they are, in \\r\\neffect, using counterfeit money. Periodically, many air-for-assets acquisitions have taken place, the late 1960s \\r\\nhaving been a particularly obscene period for such chicanery. Indeed, certain large companies were built in this \\r\\nway. (No one involved, of course, ever publicly acknowledges the reality of what is going on, though there is \\r\\nplenty of private snickering.) \\r\\n\\r\\nIn our BNSF acquisition, the selling shareholders quite properly evaluated our offer at $100 per share. \\r\\nThe cost to us, however, was somewhat higher since 40% of the $100 was delivered in our shares, which Charlie \\r\\nand I believed to be worth more than their market value. Fortunately, we had long owned a substantial amount of \\r\\nBNSF stock that we purchased in the market for cash. All told, therefore, only about 30% of our cost overall was \\r\\npaid with Berkshire shares. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the end, Charlie and I decided that the disadvantage of paying 30% of the price through stock was \\r\\noffset by the opportunity the acquisition gave us to deploy $22 billion of cash in a business we understood and \\r\\nliked for the long term. It has the additional virtue of being run by Matt Rose, whom we trust and admire. We \\r\\nalso like the prospect of investing additional billions over the years at reasonable rates of return. But the final \\r\\ndecision was a close one. If we had needed to use more stock to make the acquisition, it would in fact have made \\r\\nno sense. We would have then been giving up more than we were getting. \\r\\n\\r\\nI have been in dozens of board meetings in which acquisitions have been deliberated, often with the \\r\\ndirectors being instructed by high-priced investment bankers (are there any other kind?). Invariably, the bankers \\r\\ngive the board a detailed assessment of the value of the company being purchased, with emphasis on why it is \\r\\nworth far more than its market price. In more than fifty years of board memberships, however, never have I heard \\r\\nthe investment bankers (or management!) discuss the true value of what is being given. When a deal involved the \\r\\nissuance of the acquirer\\'s stock, they simply used market value to measure the cost. They did this even though \\r\\nthey would have argued that the acquirer\\'s stock price was woefully inadequate — absolutely no indicator of its \\r\\nreal value — had a takeover bid for the acquirer instead been the subject up for discussion. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen stock is the currency being contemplated in an acquisition and when directors are hearing from \\r\\nan advisor, it appears to me that there is only one way to get a rational and balanced discussion. Directors should \\r\\nhire a second advisor to make the case against the proposed acquisition, with its fee contingent on the deal not \\r\\ngoing through. Absent this drastic remedy, our recommendation in respect to the use of advisors remains: \"Don\\'t \\r\\nask the barber whether you need a haircut.\" \\r\\n\\r\\nI can\\'t resist telling you a true story from long ago. We owned stock in a large well-run bank that for \\r\\ndecades had been statutorily prevented from acquisitions. Eventually, the law was changed and our bank \\r\\nimmediately began looking for possible purchases. Its managers - fine people and able bankers - not \\r\\nunexpectedly began to behave like teenage boys who had just discovered girls. \\r\\n\\r\\nThey soon focused on a much smaller bank, also well-run and having similar financial characteristics \\r\\nin such areas as return on equity, interest margin, loan quality, etc. Our bank sold at a modest price (that\\'s why \\r\\nwe had bought into it), hovering near book value and possessing a very low price/earnings ratio. Alongside, \\r\\nthough, the small-bank owner was being wooed by other large banks in the state and was holding out for a price \\r\\nclose to three times book value. Moreover, he wanted stock, not cash. \\r\\n\\r\\nNaturally, our fellows caved in and agreed to this value-destroying deal. \"We need to show that we are \\r\\nin the hunt. Besides, it\\'s only a small deal,\" they said, as if only major harm to shareholders would have been a \\r\\nlegitimate reason for holding back. Charlie\\'s reaction at the time: \"Are we supposed to applaud because the dog \\r\\nthat fouls our lawn is a Chihuahua rather than a Saint Bernard?\" \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n17 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe seller of the smaller bank - no fool - then delivered one final demand in his negotiations. \"After \\r\\nthe merger,\" he in effect said, perhaps using words that were phrased more diplomatically than these, \"I\\'m going \\r\\nto be a large shareholder of your bank, and it will represent a huge portion of my net worth. You have to promise \\r\\nme, therefore, that you\\'ll never again do a deal this dumb.\" \\r\\n\\r\\nYes, the merger went through. The owner of the small bank became richer, we became poorer, and the \\r\\nmanagers of the big bank - newly bigger - lived happily ever after. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Annual Meeting \\r\\n\\r\\nOur best guess is that 35,000 people attended the annual meeting last year (up from 12 - no zeros \\r\\nomitted - in 1981). With our shareholder population much expanded, we expect even more this year. Therefore, \\r\\nwe will have to make a few changes in the usual routine. There will be no change, however, in our enthusiasm \\r\\nfor having you attend. Charlie and I like to meet you, answer your questions and - best of all - have you buy lots \\r\\nof goods from our businesses. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe meeting this year will be held on Saturday, May 1 st . As always, the doors will open at the Qwest \\r\\nCenter at 7 a.m., and a new Berkshire movie will be shown at 8:30. At 9:30 we will go directly to the \\r\\nquestion-and-answer period, which (with a break for lunch at the Qwest\\'s stands) will last until 3:30. After a \\r\\nshort recess, Charlie and I will convene the annual meeting at 3:45. If you decide to leave during the day\\'s \\r\\nquestion periods, please do so while Charlie is talking. (Act fast; he can be terse.) \\r\\n\\r\\nThe best reason to exit, of course, is to shop. We will help you do that by filling the 194,300-square- \\r\\nfoot hall that adjoins the meeting area with products from dozens of Berkshire subsidiaries. Last year, you did \\r\\nyour part, and most locations racked up record sales. But you can do better. (A friendly warning: If I find sales \\r\\nare lagging, I get testy and lock the exits.) \\r\\n\\r\\nGEICO will have a booth staffed by a number of its top counselors from around the country, all of \\r\\nthem ready to supply you with auto insurance quotes. In most cases, GEICO will be able to give you a \\r\\nshareholder discount (usually 8%). This special offer is permitted by 44 of the 51 jurisdictions in which we \\r\\noperate. (One supplemental point: The discount is not additive if you qualify for another, such as that given \\r\\ncertain groups.) Bring the details of your existing insurance and check out whether we can save you money. For \\r\\nat least 50% of you, I believe we can. \\r\\n\\r\\nBe sure to visit the Bookworm. Among the more than 30 books and DVDs it will offer are two new \\r\\nbooks by my sons: Howard\\'s Fragile, a volume filled with photos and commentary about lives of struggle \\r\\naround the globe and Peter\\'s Life Is What You Make It. Completing the family trilogy will be the debut of my \\r\\nsister Doris\\'s biography, a story focusing on her remarkable philanthropic activities. Also available will be Poor \\r\\nCharlie \\'s Almanack, the story of my partner. This book is something of a publishing miracle - never advertised, \\r\\nyet year after year selling many thousands of copies from its Internet site. (Should you need to ship your book \\r\\npurchases, a nearby shipping service will be available.) \\r\\n\\r\\nIf you are a big spender - or, for that matter, merely a gawker - visit Elliott Aviation on the east side of \\r\\nthe Omaha airport between noon and 5:00 p.m. on Saturday. There we will have a fleet of NetJets aircraft that \\r\\nwill get your pulse racing. \\r\\n\\r\\nAn attachment to the proxy material that is enclosed with this report explains how you can obtain the \\r\\ncredential you will need for admission to the meeting and other events. As for plane, hotel and car reservations, \\r\\nwe have again signed up American Express (800-799-6634) to give you special help. Carol Pedersen, who \\r\\nhandles these matters, does a terrific job for us each year, and I thank her for it. Hotel rooms can be hard to find, \\r\\nbut work with Carol and you will get one. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n18 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAt Nebraska Furniture Mart, located on a 77-acre site on 72 nd Street between Dodge and Pacific, we \\r\\nwill again be having \"Berkshire Weekend\" discount pricing. To obtain the Berkshire discount, you must make \\r\\nyour purchases between Thursday, April 29 th and Monday, May 3 rd inclusive, and also present your meeting \\r\\ncredential. The period\\'s special pricing will even apply to the products of several prestigious manufacturers that \\r\\nnormally have ironclad rules against discounting but which, in the spirit of our shareholder weekend, have made \\r\\nan exception for you. We appreciate their cooperation. NFM is open from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday through \\r\\nSaturday, and 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Sunday. On Saturday this year, from 5:30 p.m. to 8 p.m., NFM is having a \\r\\nBerkyville BBQ to which you are all invited. \\r\\n\\r\\nAt Borsheims, we will again have two shareholder-only events. The first will be a cocktail reception \\r\\nfrom 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. on Friday, April 30 th . The second, the main gala, will be held on Sunday, May 2 nd , from 9 \\r\\na.m. to 4 p.m. On Saturday, we will be open until 6 p.m. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe will have huge crowds at Borsheims throughout the weekend. For your convenience, therefore, \\r\\nshareholder prices will be available from Monday, April 26 th through Saturday, May 8 th . During that period, \\r\\nplease identify yourself as a shareholder by presenting your meeting credentials or a brokerage statement that \\r\\nshows you are a Berkshire holder. Enter with rhinestones; leave with diamonds. My daughter tells me that the \\r\\nmore you buy, the more you save (kids say the darnedest things). \\r\\n\\r\\nOn Sunday, in the mall outside of Borsheims, a blindfolded Patrick Wolff, twice U.S. chess champion, \\r\\nwill take on all comers - who will have their eyes wide open - in groups of six. Nearby, Norman Beck, a \\r\\nremarkable magician from Dallas, will bewilder onlookers. \\r\\n\\r\\nOur special treat for shareholders this year will be the return of my friend, Ariel Hsing, the country\\'s \\r\\ntop-ranked junior table tennis player (and a good bet to win at the Olympics some day). Now 14, Ariel came to \\r\\nthe annual meeting four years ago and demolished all comers, including me. (You can witness my humiliating \\r\\ndefeat on YouTube; just type in Ariel Hsing Berkshire.) \\r\\n\\r\\nNaturally, I\\'ve been plotting a comeback and will take her on outside of Borsheims at 1:00 p.m. on \\r\\nSunday. It will be a three-point match, and after I soften her up, all shareholders are invited to try their luck at \\r\\nsimilar three-point contests. Winners will be given a box of See\\'s candy. We will have equipment available, but \\r\\nbring your own paddle if you think it will help. (It won\\'t.) \\r\\n\\r\\nGorat\\'s will again be open exclusively for Berkshire shareholders on Sunday, May 2 nd , and will be \\r\\nserving from 1 p.m. until 10 p.m. Last year, though, it was overwhelmed by demand. With many more diners \\r\\nexpected this year, I\\'ve asked my friend, Donna Sheehan, at Piccolo\\'s - another favorite restaurant of mine - to \\r\\nserve shareholders on Sunday as well. (Piccolo\\'s giant root beer float is mandatory for any fan of fine dining.) I \\r\\nplan to eat at both restaurants: All of the weekend action makes me really hungry, and I have favorite dishes at \\r\\neach spot. Remember: To make a reservation at Gorat\\'s, call 402-551-3733 on April 1 st (but not before) and at \\r\\nPiccolo\\'s call 402-342-9038. \\r\\n\\r\\nRegrettably, we will not be able to have a reception for international visitors this year. Our count grew \\r\\nto about 800 last year, and my simply signing one item per person took about 2 Vi hours. Since we expect even \\r\\nmore international visitors this year, Charlie and I decided we must drop this function. But be assured, we \\r\\nwelcome every international visitor who comes. \\r\\n\\r\\nLast year we changed our method of determining what questions would be asked at the meeting and \\r\\nreceived many dozens of letters applauding the new arrangement. We will therefore again have the same three \\r\\nfinancial journalists lead the question-and-answer period, asking Charlie and me questions that shareholders have \\r\\nsubmitted to them by e-mail. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n19 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe journalists and their e-mail addresses are: Carol Loomis, of Fortune, who may be e-mailed at \\r\\ncloomis@fortunemail.com; Becky Quick, of CNBC, at BerkshireQuestions@cnbc.com, and Andrew Ross \\r\\nSorkin, of The New York Times, at arsorkin@nytimes.com. From the questions submitted, each journalist will \\r\\nchoose the dozen or so he or she decides are the most interesting and important. The journalists have told me \\r\\nyour question has the best chance of being selected if you keep it concise and include no more than two questions \\r\\nin any e-mail you send them. (In your e-mail, let the journalist know if you would like your name mentioned if \\r\\nyour question is selected.) \\r\\n\\r\\nNeither Charlie nor I will get so much as a clue about the questions to be asked. We know the \\r\\njournalists will pick some tough ones and that\\'s the way we like it. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe will again have a drawing at 8:15 on Saturday at each of 13 microphones for those shareholders \\r\\nwishing to ask questions themselves. At the meeting, I will alternate the questions asked by the journalists with \\r\\nthose from the winning shareholders. We\\'ve added 30 minutes to the question time and will probably have time \\r\\nfor about 30 questions from each group. \\r\\n\\r\\nAt 86 and 79, Charlie and I remain lucky beyond our dreams. We were born in America; had terrific \\r\\nparents who saw that we got good educations; have enjoyed wonderful families and great health; and came \\r\\nequipped with a \"business\" gene that allows us to prosper in a manner hugely disproportionate to that \\r\\nexperienced by many people who contribute as much or more to our society\\'s well-being. Moreover, we have \\r\\nlong had jobs that we love, in which we are helped in countless ways by talented and cheerful associates. Indeed, \\r\\nover the years, our work has become ever more fascinating; no wonder we tap-dance to work. If pushed, we \\r\\nwould gladly pay substantial sums to have our jobs (but don\\'t tell the Comp Committee). \\r\\n\\r\\nNothing, however, is more fun for us than getting together with our shareholder-partners at Berkshire\\'s \\r\\nannual meeting. So join us on May 1 st at the Qwest for our annual Woodstock for Capitalists. We\\'ll see you \\r\\nthere. \\r\\n\\r\\nFebruary 26, 20 1 Warren E.

In this table, Berkshire\\'s results \\r\\nthrough 1978 have been restated to conform to the changed rules. In all other respects, the results are calculated using \\r\\nthe numbers originally reported. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe S&P 500 numbers are pre-tax whereas the Berkshire numbers are after-tax. If a corporation such as Berkshire \\r\\nwere simply to have owned the S&P 500 and accrued the appropriate taxes, its results would have lagged the S&P 500 \\r\\nin years when that index showed a positive return, but would have exceeded the S&P 500 in years when the index \\r\\nshowed a negative return. Over the years, the tax costs would have caused the aggregate lag to be substantial. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n2 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.: \\r\\n\\r\\nThe per-share book value of both our Class A and Class B stock increased by 13% in 2010. Over the \\r\\nlast 46 years (that is, since present management took over), book value has grown from $19 to $95,453, a rate of \\r\\n20.2% compounded annually.* \\r\\n\\r\\nThe highlight of 2010 was our acquisition of Burlington Northern Santa Fe, a purchase that\\'s working \\r\\nout even better than I expected. It now appears that owning this railroad will increase Berkshire\\'s \"normal\" \\r\\nearning power by nearly 40% pre-tax and by well over 30% after-tax. Making this purchase increased our share \\r\\ncount by 6% and used $22 billion of cash. Since we\\'ve quickly replenished the cash, the economics of this \\r\\ntransaction have turned out very well. \\r\\n\\r\\nA \"normal year,\" of course, is not something that either Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of Berkshire \\r\\nand my partner, or I can define with anything like precision. But for the purpose of estimating our current earning \\r\\npower, we are envisioning a year free of a mega-catastrophe in insurance and possessing a general business \\r\\nclimate somewhat better than that of 2010 but weaker than that of 2005 or 2006. Using these assumptions, and \\r\\nseveral others that I will explain in the \"Investment\" section, I can estimate that the normal earning power of the \\r\\nassets we currently own is about $17 billion pre-tax and $12 billion after-tax, excluding any capital gains or \\r\\nlosses. Every day Charlie and I think about how we can build on this base. \\r\\n\\r\\nBoth of us are enthusiastic about BNSF\\'s future because railroads have major cost and environmental \\r\\nadvantages over trucking, their main competitor. Last year BNSF moved each ton of freight it carried a record \\r\\n500 miles on a single gallon of diesel fuel. That\\'s three times more fuel-efficient than trucking is, which means \\r\\nour railroad owns an important advantage in operating costs. Concurrently, our country gains because of reduced \\r\\ngreenhouse emissions and a much smaller need for imported oil. When traffic travels by rail, society benefits. \\r\\n\\r\\nOver time, the movement of goods in the United States will increase, and BNSF should get its full \\r\\nshare of the gain. The railroad will need to invest massively to bring about this growth, but no one is better \\r\\nsituated than Berkshire to supply the funds required. However slow the economy, or chaotic the markets, our \\r\\nchecks will clear. \\r\\n\\r\\nLast year - in the face of widespread pessimism about our economy - we demonstrated our enthusiasm \\r\\nfor capital investment at Berkshire by spending $6 billion on property and equipment. Of this amount, \\r\\n$5.4 billion - or 90% of the total - was spent in the United States. Certainly our businesses will expand abroad in \\r\\nthe future, but an overwhelming part of their future investments will be at home. In 2011, we will set a new \\r\\nrecord for capital spending - $8 billion - and spend all of the $2 billion increase in the United States. \\r\\n\\r\\nMoney will always flow toward opportunity, and there is an abundance of that in America. \\r\\nCommentators today often talk of \"great uncertainty.\" But think back, for example, to December 6, \\r\\n1941, October 18, 1987 and September 10, 2001. No matter how serene today may be, tomorrow is always \\r\\nuncertain. \\r\\n\\r\\n* All per-share figures used in this report apply to Berkshire\\'s A shares. Figures for the B shares are \\r\\n1/1 500 th of those shown for A. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n3 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDon\\'t let that reality spook you. Throughout my lifetime, politicians and pundits have constantly \\r\\nmoaned about terrifying problems facing America. Yet our citizens now live an astonishing six times better than \\r\\nwhen I was born. The prophets of doom have overlooked the all-important factor that is certain: Human potential \\r\\nis far from exhausted, and the American system for unleashing that potential - a system that has worked wonders \\r\\nfor over two centuries despite frequent interruptions for recessions and even a Civil War - remains alive and \\r\\neffective. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe are not natively smarter than we were when our country was founded nor do we work harder. But \\r\\nlook around you and see a world beyond the dreams of any colonial citizen. Now, as in 1776, 1861, 1932 and \\r\\n1941, America\\'s best days lie ahead. \\r\\n\\r\\nPerformance \\r\\n\\r\\nCharlie and I believe that those entrusted with handling the funds of others should establish \\r\\nperformance goals at the onset of their stewardship. Lacking such standards, managements are tempted to shoot \\r\\nthe arrow of performance and then paint the bull\\'s-eye around wherever it lands. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn Berkshire\\'s case, we long ago told you that our job is to increase per-share intrinsic value at a rate \\r\\ngreater than the increase (including dividends) of the S&P 500. In some years we succeed; in others we fail. But, \\r\\nif we are unable over time to reach that goal, we have done nothing for our investors, who by themselves could \\r\\nhave realized an equal or better result by owning an index fund. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe challenge, of course, is the calculation of intrinsic value. Present that task to Charlie and me \\r\\nseparately, and you will get two different answers. Precision just isn\\'t possible. \\r\\n\\r\\nTo eliminate subjectivity, we therefore use an understated proxy for intrinsic-value - book value - \\r\\nwhen measuring our performance. To be sure, some of our businesses are worth far more than their carrying \\r\\nvalue on our books. (Later in this report, we\\'ll present a case study.) But since that premium seldom swings \\r\\nwildly from year to year, book value can serve as a reasonable device for tracking how we are doing. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe table on page 2 shows our 46-year record against the S&P, a performance quite good in the earlier \\r\\nyears and now only satisfactory. The bountiful years, we want to emphasize, will never return. The huge sums of \\r\\ncapital we currently manage eliminate any chance of exceptional performance. We will strive, however, for \\r\\nbetter-than-average results and feel it fair for you to hold us to that standard. \\r\\n\\r\\nYearly figures, it should be noted, are neither to be ignored nor viewed as all-important. The pace of \\r\\nthe earth\\'s movement around the sun is not synchronized with the time required for either investment ideas or \\r\\noperating decisions to bear fruit. At GEICO, for example, we enthusiastically spent $900 million last year on \\r\\nadvertising to obtain policyholders who deliver us no immediate profits. If we could spend twice that amount \\r\\nproductively, we would happily do so though short-term results would be further penalized. Many large \\r\\ninvestments at our railroad and utility operations are also made with an eye to payoffs well down the road. \\r\\n\\r\\nTo provide you a longer-term perspective on performance, we present on the facing page the yearly \\r\\nfigures from page 2 recast into a series of five-year periods. Overall, there are 42 of these periods, and they tell \\r\\nan interesting story. On a comparative basis, our best years ended in the early 1980s. The market\\'s golden period, \\r\\nhowever, came in the 17 following years, with Berkshire achieving stellar absolute returns even as our relative \\r\\nadvantage narrowed. \\r\\n\\r\\nAfter 1999, the market stalled (or have you already noticed that?). Consequently, the satisfactory \\r\\nperformance relative to the S&P that Berkshire has achieved since then has delivered only moderate absolute \\r\\nresults. \\r\\n\\r\\nLooking forward, we hope to average several points better than the S&P - though that result is, of \\r\\ncourse, far from a sure thing. If we succeed in that aim, we will almost certainly produce better relative results in \\r\\nbad years for the stock market and suffer poorer results in strong markets. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n4 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBerkshire\\'s Corporate Performance vs. the S&P 500 by Five- Year Periods \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAnnual Percentage Change \\r\\n\\r\\nin Per-Share in S&P 500 \\r\\nBook Value of with Dividends Relative \\r\\n\\r\\nBerkshire Included Results \\r\\n\\r\\nFive- Year Period (1) (2) (l)-(2) \\r\\n\\r\\n1965- 1969 17.2 5.0 12.2 \\r\\n\\r\\n1966- 1970 14.7 3.9 10.8 \\r\\n\\r\\n1967- 1971 13.9 9.2 4.7 \\r\\n\\r\\n1968- 1972 16.8 7.5 9.3 \\r\\n\\r\\n1969- 1973 17.7 2.0 15.7 \\r\\n\\r\\n1970- 1974 15.0 (2.4) 17.4 \\r\\n\\r\\n1971- 1975 13.9 3.2 10.7 \\r\\n\\r\\n1972- 1976 20.8 4.9 15.9 \\r\\n\\r\\n1973- 1977 23.4 (0.2) 23.6 \\r\\n\\r\\n1974- 1978 24.4 4.3 20.1 \\r\\n\\r\\n1975- 1979 30.1 14.7 15.4 \\r\\n\\r\\n1976- 1980 33.4 13.9 19.5 \\r\\n\\r\\n1977- 1981 29.0 8.1 20.9 \\r\\n\\r\\n1978- 1982 29.9 14.1 15.8 \\r\\n\\r\\n1979- 1983 31.6 17.3 14.3 \\r\\n\\r\\n1980- 1984 27.0 14.8 12.2 \\r\\n\\r\\n1981- 1985 32.6 14.6 18.0 \\r\\n\\r\\n1982- 1986 31.5 19.8 11.7 \\r\\n\\r\\n1983- 1987 27.4 16.4 11.0 \\r\\n\\r\\n1984- 1988 25.0 15.2 9.8 \\r\\n\\r\\n1985- 1989 31.1 20.3 10.8 \\r\\n\\r\\n1986- 1990 22.9 13.1 9.8 \\r\\n\\r\\n1987- 1991 25.4 15.3 10.1 \\r\\n\\r\\n1988- 1992 25.6 15.8 9.8 \\r\\n\\r\\n1989- 1993 24.4 14.5 9.9 \\r\\n\\r\\n1990- 1994 18.6 8.7 9.9 \\r\\n\\r\\n1991- 1995 25.6 16.5 9.1 \\r\\n\\r\\n1992- 1996 24.2 15.2 9.0 \\r\\n\\r\\n1993- 1997 26.9 20.2 6.7 \\r\\n\\r\\n1994- 1998 33.7 24.0 9.7 \\r\\n\\r\\n1995- 1999 30.4 28.5 1.9 \\r\\n\\r\\n1996- 2000 22.9 18.3 4.6 \\r\\n\\r\\n1997- 2001 14.8 10.7 4.1 \\r\\n\\r\\n1998- 2002 10.4 (0.6) 11.0 \\r\\n\\r\\n1999- 2003 6.0 (0.6) 6.6 \\r\\n\\r\\n2000- 2004 8.0 (2.3) 10.3 \\r\\n\\r\\n2001- 2005 8.0 0.6 7.4 \\r\\n\\r\\n2002- 2006 13.1 6.2 6.9 \\r\\n\\r\\n2003- 2007 13.3 12.8 0.5 \\r\\n\\r\\n2004- 2008 6.9 (2.2) 9.1 \\r\\n\\r\\n2005- 2009 8.6 0.4 8.2 \\r\\n\\r\\n2006- 2010 10.0 2.3 7.7 \\r\\n\\r\\nNotes: The first two periods cover the five years beginning September 30 of the previous year.

Charlie and I rely heavily on these measurements when we make our own estimates of Berkshire\\'s \\r\\nvalue. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe first component of value is our investments: stocks, bonds and cash equivalents. At yearend these \\r\\ntotaled $158 billion at market value. \\r\\n\\r\\nInsurance float - money we temporarily hold in our insurance operations that does not belong to us - \\r\\nfunds $66 billion of our investments. This float is \"free\" as long as insurance underwriting breaks even, meaning \\r\\nthat the premiums we receive equal the losses and expenses we incur. Of course, underwriting results are volatile, \\r\\nswinging erratically between profits and losses. Over our entire history, though, we\\'ve been significantly \\r\\nprofitable, and I also expect us to average breakeven results or better in the future. If we do that, all of our \\r\\ninvestments - those funded both by float and by retained earnings - can be viewed as an element of value for \\r\\nBerkshire shareholders. \\r\\n\\r\\nBerkshire\\'s second component of value is earnings that come from sources other than investments and \\r\\ninsurance underwriting. These earnings are delivered by our 68 non-insurance companies, itemized on page 106. \\r\\nIn Berkshire\\'s early years, we focused on the investment side. During the past two decades, however, we\\'ve \\r\\nincreasingly emphasized the development of earnings from non-insurance businesses, a practice that will \\r\\ncontinue. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe following tables illustrate this shift. In the first table, we present per-share investments at decade \\r\\nintervals beginning in 1970, three years after we entered the insurance business. We exclude those investments \\r\\napplicable to minority interests. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPer-Share Compounded Annual Increase \\r\\n\\r\\nYearend Investments Period in Per-Share Investments \\r\\n\\r\\n1970 $ 66 \\r\\n\\r\\n1980 754 1970-1980 27.5% \\r\\n\\r\\n1990 7,798 1980-1990 26.3% \\r\\n\\r\\n2000 50,229 1990-2000 20.5% \\r\\n\\r\\n2010 94,730 2000-2010 6.6% \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThough our compounded annual increase in per-share investments was a healthy 19.9% over the \\r\\n40-year period, our rate of increase has slowed sharply as we have focused on using funds to buy operating \\r\\nbusinesses. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe payoff from this shift is shown in the following table, which illustrates how earnings of our \\r\\nnon-insurance businesses have increased, again on a per-share basis and after applicable minority interests. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPer-Share Compounded Annual Increase in \\r\\n\\r\\nYear Pre-Tax Earnings Period Per-Share Pre-Tax Earnings \\r\\n\\r\\n1970 $ 2.87 \\r\\n\\r\\n1980 19.01 1970-1980 20.8% \\r\\n\\r\\n1990 102.58 1980-1990 18.4% \\r\\n\\r\\n2000 918.66 1990-2000 24.5% \\r\\n\\r\\n2010 5,926.04 2000-2010 20.5% \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n6 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the forty years, our compounded annual gain in pre-tax, non-insurance earnings per share is 21.0%. \\r\\nDuring the same period, Berkshire\\'s stock price increased at a rate of 22.1% annually. Over time, you can expect \\r\\nour stock price to move in rough tandem with Berkshire\\'s investments and earnings. Market price and intrinsic \\r\\nvalue often follow very different paths - sometimes for extended periods - but eventually they meet. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a third, more subjective, element to an intrinsic value calculation that can be either positive or \\r\\nnegative: the efficacy with which retained earnings will be deployed in the future. We, as well as many other \\r\\nbusinesses, are likely to retain earnings over the next decade that will equal, or even exceed, the capital we presently \\r\\nemploy. Some companies will turn these retained dollars into fifty-cent pieces, others into two-dollar bills. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis \"what-will-they-do-with-the-money\" factor must always be evaluated along with the \\r\\n\"what-do-we-have-now\" calculation in order for us, or anybody, to arrive at a sensible estimate of a company\\'s \\r\\nintrinsic value. That\\'s because an outside investor stands by helplessly as management reinvests his share of the \\r\\ncompany\\'s earnings. If a CEO can be expected to do this job well, the reinvestment prospects add to the \\r\\ncompany\\'s current value; if the CEO\\'s talents or motives are suspect, today\\'s value must be discounted. The \\r\\ndifference in outcome can be huge. A dollar of then-value in the hands of Sears Roebuck\\'s or Montgomery \\r\\nWard\\'s CEOs in the late 1960s had a far different destiny than did a dollar entrusted to Sam Walton. \\r\\n\\r\\nCharlie and I hope that the per-share earnings of our non-insurance businesses continue to increase at a \\r\\ndecent rate. But the job gets tougher as the numbers get larger. We will need both good performance from our \\r\\ncurrent businesses and more major acquisitions. We\\'re prepared. Our elephant gun has been reloaded, and my \\r\\ntrigger finger is itchy. \\r\\n\\r\\nPartially offsetting our anchor of size are several important advantages we have. First, we possess a \\r\\ncadre of truly skilled managers who have an unusual commitment to their own operations and to Berkshire. \\r\\nMany of our CEOs are independently wealthy and work only because they love what they do. They are \\r\\nvolunteers, not mercenaries. Because no one can offer them a job they would enjoy more, they can\\'t be lured \\r\\naway. \\r\\n\\r\\nAt Berkshire, managers can focus on running their businesses: They are not subjected to meetings at \\r\\nheadquarters nor financing worries nor Wall Street harassment. They simply get a letter from me every two years \\r\\n(it\\'s reproduced on pages 104-105) and call me when they wish. And their wishes do differ: There are managers \\r\\nto whom I have not talked in the last year, while there is one with whom I talk almost daily. Our trust is in people \\r\\nrather than process. A \"hire well, manage little\" code suits both them and me. \\r\\n\\r\\nBerkshire\\'s CEOs come in many forms. Some have MB As; others never finished college. Some use \\r\\nbudgets and are by-the-book types; others operate by the seat of their pants. Our team resembles a baseball squad \\r\\ncomposed of all-stars having vastly different batting styles. Changes in our line-up are seldom required. \\r\\n\\r\\nOur second advantage relates to the allocation of the money our businesses earn. After meeting the \\r\\nneeds of those businesses, we have very substantial sums left over. Most companies limit themselves to \\r\\nreinvesting funds within the industry in which they have been operating. That often restricts them, however, to a \\r\\n\"universe\" for capital allocation that is both tiny and quite inferior to what is available in the wider world. \\r\\nCompetition for the few opportunities that are available tends to become fierce. The seller has the upper hand, as \\r\\na girl might if she were the only female at a party attended by many boys. That lopsided situation would be great \\r\\nfor the girl, but terrible for the boys. \\r\\n\\r\\nAt Berkshire we face no institutional restraints when we deploy capital. Charlie and I are limited only \\r\\nby our ability to understand the likely future of a possible acquisition. If we clear that hurdle - and frequently we \\r\\ncan\\'t - we are then able to compare any one opportunity against a host of others. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n7 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I took control of Berkshire in 1965, I didn\\'t exploit this advantage. Berkshire was then only in \\r\\ntextiles, where it had in the previous decade lost significant money. The dumbest thing I could have done was to \\r\\npursue \"opportunities\" to improve and expand the existing textile operation - so for years that\\'s exactly what I \\r\\ndid. And then, in a final burst of brilliance, I went out and bought another textile company. Aaaaaaargh! \\r\\nEventually I came to my senses, heading first into insurance and then into other industries. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere is even a supplement to this world-is-our-oyster advantage: In addition to evaluating the \\r\\nattractions of one business against a host of others, we also measure businesses against opportunities available in \\r\\nmarketable securities, a comparison most managements don\\'t make. Often, businesses are priced ridiculously \\r\\nhigh against what can likely be earned from investments in stocks or bonds. At such moments, we buy securities \\r\\nand bide our time. \\r\\n\\r\\nOur flexibility in respect to capital allocation has accounted for much of our progress to date. We have \\r\\nbeen able to take money we earn from, say, See\\'s Candies or Business Wire (two of our best-run businesses, but \\r\\nalso two offering limited reinvestment opportunities) and use it as part of the stake we needed to buy BNSF. \\r\\n\\r\\nOur final advantage is the hard-to-duplicate culture that permeates Berkshire. And in businesses, \\r\\nculture counts. \\r\\n\\r\\nTo start with, the directors who represent you think and act like owners. They receive token \\r\\ncompensation: no options, no restricted stock and, for that matter, virtually no cash. We do not provide them \\r\\ndirectors and officers liability insurance, a given at almost every other large public company. If they mess up \\r\\nwith your money, they will lose their money as well. Leaving my holdings aside, directors and their families own \\r\\nBerkshire shares worth more than $3 billion. Our directors, therefore, monitor Berkshire\\'s actions and results \\r\\nwith keen interest and an owner\\'s eye. You and I are lucky to have them as stewards. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis same owner-orientation prevails among our managers. In many cases, these are people who have \\r\\nsought out Berkshire as an acquirer for a business that they and their families have long owned. They came to us \\r\\nwith an owner\\'s mindset, and we provide an environment that encourages them to retain it. Having managers \\r\\nwho love their businesses is no small advantage. \\r\\n\\r\\nCultures self-propagate. Winston Churchill once said, \"You shape your houses and then they shape \\r\\nyou.\" That wisdom applies to businesses as well. Bureaucratic procedures beget more bureaucracy, and imperial \\r\\ncorporate palaces induce imperious behavior. (As one wag put it, \"You know you\\'re no longer CEO when you \\r\\nget in the back seat of your car and it doesn\\'t move.\") At Berkshire\\'s \"World Headquarters\" our annual rent is \\r\\n$270,212. Moreover, the home-office investment in furniture, art, Coke dispenser, lunch room, high-tech \\r\\nequipment - you name it - totals $301,363. As long as Charlie and I treat your money as if it were our own, \\r\\nBerkshire\\'s managers are likely to be careful with it as well. \\r\\n\\r\\nOur compensation programs, our annual meeting and even our annual reports are all designed with an \\r\\neye to reinforcing the Berkshire culture, and making it one that will repel and expel managers of a different bent. \\r\\nThis culture grows stronger every year, and it will remain intact long after Charlie and I have left the scene. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe will need all of the strengths I\\'ve just described to do reasonably well. Our managers will deliver; \\r\\nyou can count on that. But whether Charlie and I can hold up our end in capital allocation depends in part on the \\r\\ncompetitive environment for acquisitions. You will get our best efforts. \\r\\n\\r\\nGEICO \\r\\n\\r\\nNow let me tell you a story that will help you understand how the intrinsic value of a business can far \\r\\nexceed its book value. Relating this tale also gives me a chance to relive some great memories. \\r\\n\\r\\nSixty years ago last month, GEICO entered my life, destined to shape it in a huge way. I was then a \\r\\n20-year-old graduate student at Columbia, having elected to go there because my hero, Ben Graham, taught a \\r\\nonce-a-week class at the school. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n8 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOne day at the library, I checked out Ben\\'s entry in Who\\'s Who in America and found he was \\r\\nchairman of Government Employees Insurance Co. (now called GEICO). I knew nothing of insurance and had \\r\\nnever heard of the company. The librarian, however, steered me to a large compendium of insurers and, after \\r\\nreading the page on GEICO, I decided to visit the company. The following Saturday, I boarded an early train for \\r\\nWashington. \\r\\n\\r\\nAlas, when I arrived at the company\\'s headquarters, the building was closed. I then rather frantically \\r\\nstarted pounding on a door, until finally a janitor appeared. I asked him if there was anyone in the office I could \\r\\ntalk to, and he steered me to the only person around, Lorimer Davidson. \\r\\n\\r\\nThat was my lucky moment. During the next four hours, \"Davy\" gave me an education about both \\r\\ninsurance and GEICO. It was the beginning of a wonderful friendship. Soon thereafter, I graduated from \\r\\nColumbia and became a stock salesman in Omaha. GEICO, of course, was my prime recommendation, which got \\r\\nme off to a great start with dozens of customers. GEICO also jump-started my net worth because, soon after \\r\\nmeeting Davy, I made the stock 75% of my $9,800 investment portfolio. (Even so, I felt over-diversified.) \\r\\n\\r\\nSubsequently, Davy became CEO of GEICO, taking the company to undreamed-of heights before it got \\r\\ninto trouble in the mid-1970s, a few years after his retirement. When that happened - with the stock falling by \\r\\nmore than 95% - Berkshire bought about one-third of the company in the market, a position that over the years \\r\\nincreased to 50% because of GEICO\\'s repurchases of its own shares. Berkshire\\'s cost for this half of the business \\r\\nwas $46 million. (Despite the size of our position, we exercised no control over operations.) \\r\\n\\r\\nWe then purchased the remaining 50% of GEICO at the beginning of 1996, which spurred Davy, at 95, \\r\\nto make a video tape saying how happy he was that his beloved GEICO would permanently reside with \\r\\nBerkshire. (He also playfully concluded with, \"Next time, Warren, please make an appointment.\") \\r\\n\\r\\nA lot has happened at GEICO during the last 60 years, but its core goal - saving Americans substantial \\r\\nmoney on their purchase of auto insurance - remains unchanged. (Try us at 1-800-847-7536 or \\r\\nwww.GEICO.com.) In other words, get the policyholder\\'s business by deserving his business. Focusing on this \\r\\nobjective, the company has grown to be America\\'s third-largest auto insurer, with a market share of 8.8%. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Tony Nicely, GEICO\\'s CEO, took over in 1993, that share was 2.0%, a level at which it had \\r\\nbeen stuck for more than a decade. GEICO became a different company under Tony, finding a path to consistent \\r\\ngrowth while simultaneously maintaining underwriting discipline and keeping its costs low. \\r\\n\\r\\nLet me quantify Tony\\'s achievement. When, in 1996, we bought the 50% of GEICO we didn\\'t already \\r\\nown, it cost us about $2.3 billion. That price implied a value of $4.6 billion for 100%. GEICO then had tangible \\r\\nnet worth of $1.9 billion. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe excess over tangible net worth of the implied value - $2.7 billion - was what we estimated \\r\\nGEICO\\'s \"goodwill\" to be worth at that time. That goodwill represented the economic value of the policyholders \\r\\nwho were then doing business with GEICO. In 1995, those customers had paid the company $2.8 billion in \\r\\npremiums. Consequently, we were valuing GEICO\\'s customers at about 97% (2.7/2.8) of what they were \\r\\nannually paying the company. By industry standards, that was a very high price. But GEICO was no ordinary \\r\\ninsurer: Because of the company\\'s low costs, its policyholders were consistently profitable and unusually loyal. \\r\\n\\r\\nToday, premium volume is $14.3 billion and growing. Yet we carry the goodwill of GEICO on our \\r\\nbooks at only $1.4 billion, an amount that will remain unchanged no matter how much the value of GEICO \\r\\nincreases. (Under accounting rules, you write down the carrying value of goodwill if its economic value \\r\\ndecreases, but leave it unchanged if economic value increases.) Using the 97% -of-premium- volume yardstick we \\r\\napplied to our 1996 purchase, the real value today of GEICO\\'s economic goodwill is about $14 billion. And this \\r\\nvalue is likely to be much higher ten and twenty years from now. GEICO - off to a strong start in 2011 - is the \\r\\ngift that keeps giving. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n9 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOne not-so-small footnote: Under Tony, GEICO has developed one of the country\\'s largest personal- \\r\\nlines insurance agencies, which primarily sells homeowners policies to our GEICO auto insurance customers. In \\r\\nthis business, we represent a number of insurers that are not affiliated with us. They take the risk; we simply sign \\r\\nup the customers. Last year we sold 769,898 new policies at this agency operation, up 34% from the year before. \\r\\nThe obvious way this activity aids us is that it produces commission revenue; equally important is the fact that it \\r\\nfurther strengthens our relationship with our policyholders, helping us retain them. \\r\\n\\r\\nI owe an enormous debt to Tony and Davy (and, come to think of it, to that janitor as well). \\r\\n\\r\\nNow, let\\'s examine the four major sectors of Berkshire. Each has vastly different balance sheet and \\r\\nincome characteristics from the others. Lumping them together therefore impedes analysis. So we\\'ll present them \\r\\nas four separate businesses, which is how Charlie and I view them. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe will look first at insurance, Berkshire\\'s core operation and the engine that has propelled our \\r\\nexpansion over the years. \\r\\n\\r\\nInsurance \\r\\n\\r\\nProperty-casualty (\"P/C\") insurers receive premiums upfront and pay claims later. In extreme cases, \\r\\nsuch as those arising from certain workers\\' compensation accidents, payments can stretch over decades. This \\r\\ncollect-now, pay-later model leaves us holding large sums - money we call \"float\" - that will eventually go to \\r\\nothers. Meanwhile, we get to invest this float for Berkshire\\'s benefit. Though individual policies and claims \\r\\ncome and go, the amount of float we hold remains remarkably stable in relation to premium volume. \\r\\nConsequently, as our business grows, so does our float. And how we have grown: Just take a look at the \\r\\nfollowing table: \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFloat \\r\\n\\r\\nYearend (in $ millions) \\r\\n\\r\\n1970 $ 39 \\r\\n\\r\\n1980 237 \\r\\n\\r\\n1990 1,632 \\r\\n\\r\\n2000 27,871 \\r\\n\\r\\n2010 65,832 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIf our premiums exceed the total of our expenses and eventual losses, we register an underwriting profit \\r\\nthat adds to the investment income that our float produces. When such a profit occurs, we enjoy the use of free \\r\\nmoney - and, better yet, get paid for holding it. Alas, the wish of all insurers to achieve this happy result creates \\r\\nintense competition, so vigorous in most years that it causes the P/C industry as a whole to operate at a \\r\\nsignificant underwriting loss. This loss, in effect, is what the industry pays to hold its float. For example, State \\r\\nFarm, by far the country\\'s largest insurer and a well-managed company, has incurred an underwriting loss in \\r\\nseven of the last ten years. During that period, its aggregate underwriting loss was more than $20 billion. \\r\\n\\r\\nAt Berkshire, we have now operated at an underwriting profit for eight consecutive years, our total \\r\\nunderwriting gain for the period having been $17 billion. I believe it likely that we will continue to underwrite \\r\\nprofitably in most - though certainly not all - future years. If we accomplish that, our float will be better than \\r\\ncost-free. We will benefit just as we would if some party deposited $66 billion with us, paid us a fee for holding \\r\\nits money and then let us invest its funds for our own benefit. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n10 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLet me emphasize again that cost-free float is not an outcome to be expected for the P/C industry as a \\r\\nwhole: In most years, industry premiums have been inadequate to cover claims plus expenses. Consequently, the \\r\\nindustry\\'s overall return on tangible equity has for many decades fallen far short of the average return realized by \\r\\nAmerican industry, a sorry performance almost certain to continue. Berkshire\\'s outstanding economics exist only \\r\\nbecause we have some terrific managers running some unusual businesses. We\\'ve already told you about GEICO, \\r\\nbut we have two other very large operations, and a bevy of smaller ones as well, each a star in its own way. \\r\\n\\r\\nFirst off is the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group, run by Ajit Jain. Ajit insures risks that no one \\r\\nelse has the desire or the capital to take on. His operation combines capacity, speed, decisiveness and, most \\r\\nimportantly, brains in a manner that is unique in the insurance business. Yet he never exposes Berkshire to risks \\r\\nthat are inappropriate in relation to our resources. Indeed, we are, far more conservative than most large insurers \\r\\nin that respect. In the past year, Ajit has significantly increased his life reinsurance operation, developing annual \\r\\npremium volume of about $2 billion that will repeat for decades. \\r\\n\\r\\nFrom a standing start in 1985, Ajit has created an insurance business with float of $30 billion and \\r\\nsignificant underwriting profits, a feat that no CEO of any other insurer has come close to matching. By his \\r\\naccomplishments, he has added a great many billions of dollars to the value of Berkshire. Even kryptonite \\r\\nbounces off Ajit. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe have another insurance powerhouse in General Re, managed by Tad Montross. \\r\\n\\r\\nAt bottom, a sound insurance operation requires four disciplines: (1) An understanding of all exposures \\r\\nthat might cause a policy to incur losses; (2) A conservative evaluation of the likelihood of any exposure actually \\r\\ncausing a loss and the probable cost if it does; (3) The setting of a premium that will deliver a profit, on average, \\r\\nafter both prospective loss costs and operating expenses are covered; and (4) The willingness to walk away if the \\r\\nappropriate premium can\\'t be obtained. \\r\\n\\r\\nMany insurers pass the first three tests and flunk the fourth. The urgings of Wall Street, pressures from \\r\\nthe agency force and brokers, or simply a refusal by a testosterone-driven CEO to accept shrinking volumes has \\r\\nled too many insurers to write business at inadequate prices. \"The other guy is doing it so we must as well\" spells \\r\\ntrouble in any business, but none more so than insurance. \\r\\n\\r\\nTad has observed all four of the insurance commandments, and it shows in his results. General Re\\'s huge \\r\\nfloat has been better than cost-free under his leadership, and we expect that, on average, it will continue to be. \\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, we own a group of smaller companies, most of them specializing in odd corners of the \\r\\ninsurance world. In aggregate, their results have consistently been profitable and, as the table below shows, the \\r\\nfloat they provide us is substantial. Charlie and I treasure these companies and their managers. \\r\\n\\r\\nHere is the record of all four segments of our property-casualty and life insurance businesses: \\r\\n\\r\\nUnderwriting Profit Yearend Float \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n(in millions) \\r\\n\\r\\nInsurance Operations 2010 2009 2010 2009 \\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral Re $ 452 $ 477 $20,049 $21,014 \\r\\n\\r\\nBH Reinsurance 176 250 30,370 27,753 \\r\\n\\r\\nGEICO 1,117 649 10,272 9,613 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther Primary 268 84 5,141 5,061 \\r\\n\\r\\n$2,013 $1,460 $65,832 $63,441 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong large insurance operations, Berkshire\\'s impresses me as the best in the world. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n11 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nManufacturing, Service and Retailing Operations \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOur activities in this part of Berkshire cover the waterfront.

Some of the businesses \\r\\nenjoy terrific economics, measured by earnings on unleveraged net tangible assets that run from 25% after-tax to \\r\\nmore than 100%. Others produce good returns in the area of 12-20%. Unfortunately, a few have very poor \\r\\nreturns, a result of some serious mistakes I have made in my job of capital allocation. These errors came about \\r\\nbecause I misjudged either the competitive strength of the business I was purchasing or the future economics of \\r\\nthe industry in which it operated. I try to look out ten or twenty years when making an acquisition, but sometimes \\r\\nmy eyesight has been poor. \\r\\n\\r\\nMost of the companies in this section improved their earnings last year and four set records. Let\\'s look \\r\\nfirst at the record-breakers. \\r\\n\\r\\n• TTI, our electronic components distributor, had sales 21% above its previous high (recorded in 2008) \\r\\nand pre-tax earnings that topped its earlier record by 58%. Its sales gains spanned three continents, with \\r\\nNorth America at 16%, Europe at 26%, and Asia at 50%. The thousands of items TTI distributes are \\r\\npedestrian, many selling for less than a dollar. The magic of TTI\\'s exceptional performance is created \\r\\nby Paul Andrews, its CEO, and his associates. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n12 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n• Forest River, our RV and boat manufacturer, had record sales of nearly $2 billion and record earnings \\r\\nas well. Forest River has 82 plants, and I have yet to visit one (or the home office, for that matter). \\r\\nThere\\'s no need; Pete Liegl, the company\\'s CEO, runs a terrific operation. Come view his products at \\r\\nthe annual meeting. Better yet, buy one. \\r\\n\\r\\n• CTB, our farm-equipment company, again set an earnings record. I told you in the 2008 Annual Report \\r\\nabout Vic Mancinelli, the company\\'s CEO. He just keeps getting better. Berkshire paid $140 million \\r\\nfor CTB in 2002. It has since paid us dividends of $160 million and eliminated $40 million of debt. \\r\\nLast year it earned $106 million pre-tax. Productivity gains have produced much of this increase. When \\r\\nwe bought CTB, sales per employee were $189,365; now they are $405,878. \\r\\n\\r\\n• Would you believe shoes? H. H. Brown, run by Jim Issler and best known for its Born brand, set a new \\r\\nrecord for sales and earnings (helped by its selling 1,110 pairs of shoes at our annual meeting). Jim has \\r\\nbrilliantly adapted to major industry changes. His work, I should mention, is overseen by Frank \\r\\nRooney, 89, a superb businessman and still a dangerous fellow with whom to have a bet on the golf \\r\\ncourse. \\r\\n\\r\\nA huge story in this sector\\'s year-to-year improvement occurred at NetJets. I can\\'t overstate the \\r\\nbreadth and importance of Dave Sokol\\'s achievements at this company, the leading provider of fractional \\r\\nownership of jet airplanes. NetJets has long been an operational success, owning a 2010 market share five times \\r\\nthat of its nearest competitor. Our overwhelming leadership stems from a wonderful team of pilots, mechanics \\r\\nand service personnel. This crew again did its job in 2010, with customer satisfaction, as delineated in our regular \\r\\nsurveys, hitting new highs. \\r\\n\\r\\nEven though NetJets was consistently a runaway winner with customers, our financial results, since its \\r\\nacquisition in 1998, were a failure. In the 11 years through 2009, the company reported an aggregate pre-tax loss \\r\\nof $157 million, a figure that was far understated since borrowing costs at NetJets were heavily subsidized by its \\r\\nfree use of Berkshire\\'s credit. Had NetJets been operating on a stand-alone basis, its loss over the years would \\r\\nhave been several hundreds of millions greater. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe are now charging NetJets an appropriate fee for Berkshire\\'s guarantee. Despite this fee (which \\r\\ncame to $38 million in 2010), NetJets earned $207 million pre-tax in 2010, a swing of $918 million from 2009. \\r\\nDave\\'s quick restructuring of management and the company\\'s rationalization of its purchasing and spending \\r\\npolicies has ended the hemorrhaging of cash and turned what was Berkshire\\'s only major business problem into a \\r\\nsolidly profitable operation. \\r\\n\\r\\nDave has meanwhile maintained NetJets\\' industry-leading reputation for safety and service. In many \\r\\nimportant ways, our training and operational standards are considerably stronger than those required by the FAA. \\r\\nMaintaining top-of-the-line standards is the right thing to do, but I also have a selfish reason for championing this \\r\\npolicy. My family and I have flown more than 5,000 hours on NetJets (that\\'s equal to being airborne 24 hours a \\r\\nday for seven months) and will fly thousands of hours more in the future. We receive no special treatment and \\r\\nhave used a random mix of at least 100 planes and 300 crews. Whichever the plane or crew, we always know we \\r\\nare flying with the best-trained pilots in private aviation. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe largest earner in our manufacturing, service and retailing sector is Marmon, a collection of 130 \\r\\nbusinesses. We will soon increase our ownership in this company to 80% by carrying out our scheduled purchase \\r\\nof 17% of its stock from the Pritzker family. The cost will be about $1.5 billion. We will then purchase the \\r\\nremaining Pritzker holdings in 2013 or 2014, whichever date is selected by the family. Frank Ptak runs Marmon \\r\\nwonderfully, and we look forward to 100% ownership. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n13 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNext to Marmon, the two largest earners in this sector are Iscar and McLane. Both had excellent years. \\r\\nIn 2010, Grady Rosier\\' s McLane entered the wine and spirits distribution business to supplement its $32 billion \\r\\noperation as a distributor of food products, cigarettes, candy and sundries. In purchasing Empire Distributors, an \\r\\noperator in Georgia and North Carolina, we teamed up with David Kahn, the company\\'s dynamic CEO. David is \\r\\nleading our efforts to expand geographically. By yearend he had already made his first acquisition, Horizon Wine \\r\\nand Spirits in Tennessee. \\r\\n\\r\\nAt Iscar, profits were up 159% in 2010, and we may well surpass pre-recession levels in 2011. Sales \\r\\nare improving throughout the world, particularly in Asia. Credit Eitan Wertheimer, Jacob Harpaz and Danny \\r\\nGoldman for an exceptional performance, one far superior to that of Iscar\\' s main competitors. \\r\\n\\r\\nAll that is good news. Our businesses related to home construction, however, continue to struggle. \\r\\nJohns Manville, MiTek, Shaw and Acme Brick have maintained their competitive positions, but their profits are \\r\\nfar below the levels of a few years ago. Combined, these operations earned $362 million pre-tax in 2010 \\r\\ncompared to $1.3 billion in 2006, and their employment has fallen by about 9,400. \\r\\n\\r\\nA housing recovery will probably begin within a year or so. In any event, it is certain to occur at some \\r\\npoint. Consequently: (1) At MiTek, we have made, or committed to, five bolt-on acquisitions during the past \\r\\neleven months; (2) At Acme, we just recently acquired the leading manufacturer of brick in Alabama for \\r\\n$50 million; (3) Johns Manville is building a $55 million roofing membrane plant in Ohio, to be completed next \\r\\nyear; and (4) Shaw will spend $200 million in 2011 on plant and equipment, all of it situated in America. These \\r\\nbusinesses entered the recession strong and will exit it stronger. At Berkshire, our time horizon is forever. \\r\\n\\r\\nRegulated, Capital-intensive Businesses \\r\\n\\r\\nWe have two very large businesses, BNSF and MidAmerican Energy, with important common \\r\\ncharacteristics that distinguish them from our many others. Consequently, we give them their own sector in this \\r\\nletter and split out their financial statistics in our GAAP balance sheet and income statement. \\r\\n\\r\\nA key characteristic of both companies is the huge investment they have in very long-lived, regulated \\r\\nassets, with these funded by large amounts of long-term debt that is not guaranteed by Berkshire. Our credit is \\r\\nnot needed: Both businesses have earning power that, even under very adverse business conditions, amply covers \\r\\ntheir interest requirements. For example, in recessionary 2010 with BNSF\\'s car loadings far off peak levels, the \\r\\ncompany\\'s interest coverage was 6:1. \\r\\n\\r\\nBoth companies are heavily regulated, and both will have a never-ending need to make major \\r\\ninvestments in plant and equipment. Both also need to provide efficient, customer-satisfying service to earn the \\r\\nrespect of their communities and regulators. In return, both need to be assured that they will be allowed to earn \\r\\nreasonable earnings on future capital investments. \\r\\n\\r\\nEarlier I explained just how important railroads are to our country\\'s future. Rail moves 42% of \\r\\nAmerica\\'s inter-city freight, measured by ton-miles, and BNSF moves more than any other railroad - about 28% \\r\\nof the industry total. A little math will tell you that more than 11% of all inter-city ton-miles of freight in the U.S. \\r\\nis transported by BNSF. Given the shift of population to the West, our share may well inch higher. \\r\\n\\r\\nAll of this adds up to a huge responsibility. We are a major and essential part of the American \\r\\neconomy\\'s circulatory system, obliged to constantly maintain and improve our 23,000 miles of track along with \\r\\nits ancillary bridges, tunnels, engines and cars. In carrying out this job, we must anticipate society\\'s needs, not \\r\\nmerely react to them. Fulfilling our societal obligation, we will regularly spend far more than our depreciation, \\r\\nwith this excess amounting to $2 billion in 2011. I\\'m confident we will earn appropriate returns on our huge \\r\\nincremental investments. Wise regulation and wise investment are two sides of the same coin. \\r\\n\\r\\nAt MidAmerican, we participate in a similar \"social compact.\" We are expected to put up ever- \\r\\nincreasing sums to satisfy the future needs of our customers. If we meanwhile operate reliably and efficiently, we \\r\\nknow that we will obtain a fair return on these investments. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n14 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMidAmerican supplies 2.4 million customers in the U.S. with electricity, operating as the largest \\r\\nsupplier in Iowa, Wyoming and Utah and as an important provider in other states as well. Our pipelines transport \\r\\n8% of the country\\'s natural gas. Obviously, many millions of Americans depend on us every day. \\r\\n\\r\\nMidAmerican has delivered outstanding results for both its owners (Berkshire\\'s interest is 89.8%) and its \\r\\ncustomers. Shortly after MidAmerican purchased Northern Natural Gas pipeline in 2002, that company\\'s \\r\\nperformance as a pipeline was rated dead last, 43 out of 43, by the leading authority in the field. In the most recent \\r\\nreport published, Northern Natural was ranked second. The top spot was held by our other pipeline, Kern River. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn its electric business, MidAmerican has a comparable record. Iowa rates have not increased since we \\r\\npurchased our operation there in 1999. During the same period, the other major electric utility in the state has \\r\\nraised prices more than 70% and now has rates far above ours. In certain metropolitan areas in which the two \\r\\nutilities operate side by side, electric bills of our customers run far below those of their neighbors. I am told that \\r\\ncomparable houses sell at higher prices in these cities if they are located in our service area. \\r\\n\\r\\nMidAmerican will have 2,909 megawatts of wind generation in operation by the end of 2011, more \\r\\nthan any other regulated electric utility in the country. The total amount that MidAmerican has invested or \\r\\ncommitted to wind is a staggering $5.4 billion. We can make this sort of investment because MidAmerican \\r\\nretains all of its earnings, unlike other utilities that generally pay out most of what they earn. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs you can tell by now, I am proud of what has been accomplished for our society by Matt Rose at \\r\\nBNSF and by David Sokol and Greg Abel at MidAmerican. I am also both proud and grateful for what they have \\r\\naccomplished for Berkshire shareholders.

CORT experienced a pickup in business as the year progressed \\r\\nand also significantly tightened its operations. The combination increased its pre-tax results from a loss of \\r\\n$3 million in 2009 to $18 million of profit in 2010. \\r\\n\\r\\nAt Clayton, we produced 23,343 homes, 47% of the industry\\'s total of 50,046. Contrast this to the peak \\r\\nyear of 1998, when 372,843 homes were manufactured. (We then had an industry share of 8%.) Sales would have \\r\\nbeen terrible last year under any circumstances, but the financing problems I commented upon in the 2009 report \\r\\ncontinue to exacerbate the distress. To explain: Home-financing policies of our government, expressed through \\r\\nthe loans found acceptable by FHA, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, favor site-built homes and work to negate the \\r\\nprice advantage that manufactured homes offer. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe finance more manufactured-home buyers than any other company. Our experience, therefore, \\r\\nshould be instructive to those parties preparing to overhaul our country\\'s home-loan practices. Let\\'s take a look. \\r\\n\\r\\nClayton owns 200,804 mortgages that it originated. (It also has some mortgage portfolios that it \\r\\npurchased.) At the origination of these contracts, the average FICO score of our borrowers was 648, and 47% \\r\\nwere 640 or below. Your banker will tell you that people with such scores are generally regarded as questionable \\r\\ncredits. \\r\\n\\r\\nNevertheless, our portfolio has performed well during conditions of stress. Here\\'s our loss experience \\r\\nduring the last five years for originated loans: \\r\\n\\r\\nNet Losses as a Percentage \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nYear of Average Loans \\r\\n\\r\\n2006 1.53% \\r\\n\\r\\n2007 1.27% \\r\\n\\r\\n2008 1.17% \\r\\n\\r\\n2009 1.86% \\r\\n\\r\\n2010 1.72% \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOur borrowers get in trouble when they lose their jobs, have health problems, get divorced, etc. The \\r\\nrecession has hit them hard. But they want to stay in their homes, and generally they borrowed sensible amounts \\r\\nin relation to their income. In addition, we were keeping the originated mortgages for our own account, which \\r\\nmeans we were not securitizing or otherwise reselling them. If we were stupid in our lending, we were going to \\r\\npay the price. That concentrates the mind. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf home buyers throughout the country had behaved like our buyers, America would not have had the \\r\\ncrisis that it did. Our approach was simply to get a meaningful down-payment and gear fixed monthly payments \\r\\nto a sensible percentage of income. This policy kept Clayton solvent and also kept buyers in their homes. \\r\\n\\r\\nHome ownership makes sense for most Americans, particularly at today\\'s lower prices and bargain \\r\\ninterest rates. All things considered, the third best investment I ever made was the purchase of my home, though I \\r\\nwould have made far more money had I instead rented and used the purchase money to buy stocks. (The two best \\r\\ninvestments were wedding rings.) For the $31,500 I paid for our house, my family and I gained 52 years of \\r\\nterrific memories with more to come. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n16 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBut a house can be a nightmare if the buyer\\'s eyes are bigger than his wallet and if a lender - often \\r\\nprotected by a government guarantee - facilitates his fantasy. Our country\\'s social goal should not be to put \\r\\nfamilies into the house of their dreams, but rather to put them into a house they can afford. \\r\\n\\r\\nInvestments \\r\\n\\r\\nBelow we show our common stock investments that at yearend had a market value of more than \\r\\n$1 billion. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n12/31/10 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nShares \\r\\n\\r\\nCompany \\r\\n\\r\\nPercentage of \\r\\nCompany \\r\\nOwned \\r\\n\\r\\nCost* \\r\\n\\r\\nMarket \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n(in millions) \\r\\n\\r\\n151,610,700 \\r\\n\\r\\nAmerican Express Company \\r\\n\\r\\n12.6 \\r\\n\\r\\n$ 1,287 \\r\\n\\r\\n$ 6,507 \\r\\n\\r\\n225,000,000 \\r\\n\\r\\nBYD Company, Ltd \\r\\n\\r\\n9.9 \\r\\n\\r\\n232 \\r\\n\\r\\n1,182 \\r\\n\\r\\n900 OOO OOO \\r\\n\\r\\ni ne v^oca-v^oia v^-ompaiiy \\r\\n\\r\\no.O \\r\\n\\r\\n1,299 \\r\\n\\r\\n13,154 \\r\\n\\r\\n29,109,637 \\r\\n\\r\\nConocoPhillips \\r\\n\\r\\n2.0 \\r\\n\\r\\n2,028 \\r\\n\\r\\n1,982 \\r\\n\\r\\n45,022,563 \\r\\n\\r\\nJohnson & Johnson \\r\\n\\r\\n1.6 \\r\\n\\r\\n2,749 \\r\\n\\r\\n2,785 \\r\\n\\r\\n97,214,584 \\r\\n\\r\\nKraft Foods Inc \\r\\n\\r\\n5.6 \\r\\n\\r\\n3,207 \\r\\n\\r\\n3,063 \\r\\n\\r\\n19,259,600 \\r\\n\\r\\nMunich Re \\r\\n\\r\\n10.5 \\r\\n\\r\\n2,896 \\r\\n\\r\\n2,924 \\r\\n\\r\\n3,947,555 \\r\\n\\r\\nPOSCO \\r\\n\\r\\n4.6 \\r\\n\\r\\n768 \\r\\n\\r\\n1,706 \\r\\n\\r\\n72,391,036 \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Procter & Gamble Company \\r\\n\\r\\n2.6 \\r\\n\\r\\n464 \\r\\n\\r\\n4,657 \\r\\n\\r\\n25,848,838 \\r\\n\\r\\nSanofi-Aventis \\r\\n\\r\\n2.0 \\r\\n\\r\\n2,060 \\r\\n\\r\\n1,656 \\r\\n\\r\\n242,163,773 \\r\\n\\r\\nTesco pic \\r\\n\\r\\n3.0 \\r\\n\\r\\n1,414 \\r\\n\\r\\n1,608 \\r\\n\\r\\n78,060,769 \\r\\n\\r\\nU.S. Bancorp \\r\\n\\r\\n4.1 \\r\\n\\r\\n2,401 \\r\\n\\r\\n2,105 \\r\\n\\r\\n39,037,142 \\r\\n\\r\\nWal-Mart Stores, Inc \\r\\n\\r\\n1.1 \\r\\n\\r\\n1,893 \\r\\n\\r\\n2,105 \\r\\n\\r\\n358,936,125 \\r\\n\\r\\nWells Fargo & Company \\r\\n\\r\\n6.8 \\r\\n\\r\\n8,015 \\r\\n\\r\\n11,123 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOthers \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n3,020 \\r\\n\\r\\n4,956 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTotal Common Stocks Carried at Market \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n$33,733 \\r\\n\\r\\n$61,513 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*This is our actual purchase price and also our tax basis; GAAP \"cost\" differs in a few cases because of \\r\\nwrite-ups or write-downs that have been required. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn our reported earnings we reflect only the dividends our portfolio companies pay us. Our share of the \\r\\nundistributed earnings of these investees, however, was more than $2 billion last year. These retained earnings \\r\\nare important. In our experience - and, for that matter, in the experience of investors over the past century - \\r\\nundistributed earnings have been either matched or exceeded by market gains, albeit in a highly irregular manner. \\r\\n(Indeed, sometimes the correlation goes in reverse. As one investor said in 2009: \"This is worse than divorce. \\r\\nI\\'ve lost half my net worth - and I still have my wife.\") In the future, we expect our market gains to eventually at \\r\\nleast equal the earnings our investees retain. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn our earlier estimate of Berkshire\\'s normal earning power, we made three adjustments that relate to \\r\\nfuture investment income (but did not include anything for the undistributed earnings factor I have just \\r\\ndescribed). \\r\\n\\r\\nThe first adjustment was decidedly negative. Last year, we discussed five large fixed-income \\r\\ninvestments that have been contributing substantial sums to our reported earnings. One of these - our Swiss Re \\r\\nnote - was redeemed in the early days of 2011, and two others - our Goldman Sachs and General Electric \\r\\npreferred stocks - are likely to be gone by yearend. General Electric is entitled to call our preferred in October \\r\\nand has stated its intention to do so. Goldman Sachs has the right to call our preferred on 30 days notice, but has \\r\\nbeen held back by the Federal Reserve (bless it!), which unfortunately will likely give Goldman the green light \\r\\nbefore long. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n17 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAll three of the companies redeeming must pay us a premium to do so - in aggregate about $1.4 billion - \\r\\nbut all of the redemptions are nevertheless unwelcome. After they occur, our earning power will be significantly \\r\\nreduced. That\\'s the bad news. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere are two probable offsets. At yearend we held $38 billion of cash equivalents that have been \\r\\nearning a pittance throughout 2010. At some point, however, better rates will return. They will add at least \\r\\n$500 million - and perhaps much more - to our investment income. That sort of increase in money-market yields \\r\\nis unlikely to come soon. It is appropriate, nevertheless, for us to include improved rates in an estimate of \\r\\n\"normal\" earning power. Even before higher rates come about, furthermore, we could get lucky and find an \\r\\nopportunity to use some of our cash hoard at decent returns. That day can\\'t come too soon for me: To update \\r\\nAesop, a girl in a convertible is worth five in the phone book. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition, dividends on our current common stock holdings will almost certainly increase. The largest \\r\\ngain is likely to come at Wells Fargo. The Federal Reserve, our friend in respect to Goldman Sachs, has frozen \\r\\ndividend levels at major banks, whether strong or weak, during the last two years. Wells Fargo, though \\r\\nconsistently prospering throughout the worst of the recession and currently enjoying enormous financial strength \\r\\nand earning power, has therefore been forced to maintain an artificially low payout. (We don\\'t fault the Fed: For \\r\\nvarious reasons, an across-the-board freeze made sense during the crisis and its immediate aftermath.) \\r\\n\\r\\nAt some point, probably soon, the Fed\\'s restrictions will cease. Wells Fargo can then reinstate the \\r\\nrational dividend policy that its owners deserve. At that time, we would expect our annual dividends from just \\r\\nthis one security to increase by several hundreds of millions of dollars annually. \\r\\n\\r\\nOther companies we hold are likely to increase their dividends as well. Coca-Cola paid us $88 million \\r\\nin 1995, the year after we finished purchasing the stock. Every year since, Coke has increased its dividend. In \\r\\n2011, we will almost certainly receive $376 million from Coke, up $24 million from last year. Within ten years, I \\r\\nwould expect that $376 million to double. By the end of that period, I wouldn\\'t be surprised to see our share of \\r\\nCoke\\'s annual earnings exceed 100% of what we paid for the investment. Time is the friend of the wonderful \\r\\nbusiness. \\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, I believe our \"normal\" investment income will at least equal what we realized in 2010, though \\r\\nthe redemptions I described will cut our take in 2011 and perhaps 2012 as well. \\r\\n\\r\\nLast summer, Lou Simpson told me he wished to retire. Since Lou was a mere 74 - an age Charlie and \\r\\nI regard as appropriate only for trainees at Berkshire - his call was a surprise. \\r\\n\\r\\nLou joined GEICO as its investment manager in 1979, and his service to that company has been \\r\\ninvaluable. In the 2004 Annual Report, I detailed his record with equities, and I have omitted updates only \\r\\nbecause his performance made mine look bad. Who needs that? \\r\\n\\r\\nLou has never been one to advertise his talents. But I will: Simply put, Lou is one of the investment \\r\\ngreats. We will miss him. \\r\\n\\r\\nFour years ago, I told you that we needed to add one or more younger investment managers to carry on \\r\\nwhen Charlie, Lou and I weren\\'t around. At that time we had multiple outstanding candidates immediately \\r\\navailable for my CEO job (as we do now), but we did not have backup in the investment area. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\'s easy to identify many investment managers with great recent records. But past results, though \\r\\nimportant, do not suffice when prospective performance is being judged. How the record has been achieved is \\r\\ncrucial, as is the manager\\'s understanding of - and sensitivity to - risk (which in no way should be measured by \\r\\nbeta, the choice of too many academics). In respect to the risk criterion, we were looking for someone with a \\r\\nhard-to-evaluate skill: the ability to anticipate the effects of economic scenarios not previously observed. Finally, \\r\\nwe wanted someone who would regard working for Berkshire as far more than a job. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n18 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Charlie and I met Todd Combs, we knew he fit our requirements. Todd, as was the case with \\r\\nLou, will be paid a salary plus a contingent payment based on his performance relative to the S&P. We have \\r\\narrangements in place for deferrals and carryforwards that will prevent see-saw performance being met by \\r\\nundeserved payments. The hedge-fund world has witnessed some terrible behavior by general partners who have \\r\\nreceived huge payouts on the upside and who then, when bad results occurred, have walked away rich, with their \\r\\nlimited partners losing back their earlier gains. Sometimes these same general partners thereafter quickly started \\r\\nanother fund so that they could immediately participate in future profits without having to overcome their past \\r\\nlosses. Investors who put money with such managers should be labeled patsies, not partners. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs long as I am CEO, I will continue to manage the great majority of Berkshire\\'s holdings, both bonds \\r\\nand equities. Todd initially will manage funds in the range of one to three billion dollars, an amount he can reset \\r\\nannually. His focus will be equities but he is not restricted to that form of investment. (Fund consultants like to \\r\\nrequire style boxes such as \"long-short,\" \"macro,\" \"international equities.\" At Berkshire our only style box is \\r\\n\"smart.\") \\r\\n\\r\\nOver time, we may add one or two investment managers if we find the right individuals. Should we do \\r\\nthat, we will probably have 80% of each manager\\'s performance compensation be dependent on his or her own \\r\\nportfolio and 20% on that of the other manager(s). We want a compensation system that pays off big for \\r\\nindividual success but that also fosters cooperation, not competition. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Charlie and I are no longer around, our investment manager(s) will have responsibility for the \\r\\nentire portfolio in a manner then set by the CEO and Board of Directors. Because good investors bring a useful \\r\\nperspective to the purchase of businesses, we would expect them to be consulted - but not to have a vote - on the \\r\\nwisdom of possible acquisitions. In the end, of course, the Board will make the call on any major acquisition. \\r\\n\\r\\nOne footnote: When we issued a press release about Todd\\'s joining us, a number of commentators \\r\\npointed out that he was \"little-known\" and expressed puzzlement that we didn\\'t seek a \"big-name.\" I wonder \\r\\nhow many of them would have known of Lou in 1979, Ajit in 1985, or, for that matter, Charlie in 1959. Our goal \\r\\nwas to find a 2-year-old Secretariat, not a 10-year-old Seabiscuit. (Whoops - that may not be the smartest \\r\\nmetaphor for an 80-year-old CEO to use.) \\r\\n\\r\\nDerivatives \\r\\n\\r\\nTwo years ago, in the 2008 Annual Report, I told you that Berkshire was a party to 251 derivatives \\r\\ncontracts (other than those used for operations at our subsidiaries, such as MidAmerican, and the few left over at \\r\\nGen Re). Today, the comparable number is 203, a figure reflecting both a few additions to our portfolio and the \\r\\nunwinding or expiration of some contracts. \\r\\n\\r\\nOur continuing positions, all of which I am personally responsible for, fall largely into two categories. \\r\\nWe view both categories as engaging us in insurance-like activities in which we receive premiums for assuming \\r\\nrisks that others wish to shed. Indeed, the thought processes we employ in these derivatives transactions are \\r\\nidentical to those we use in our insurance business. You should also understand that we get paid up-front when \\r\\nwe enter into the contracts and therefore run no counterparty risk. That\\'s important. \\r\\n\\r\\nOur first category of derivatives consists of a number of contracts, written in 2004-2008, that required \\r\\npayments by us if there were bond defaults by companies included in certain high-yield indices. With minor \\r\\nexceptions, we were exposed to these risks for five years, with each contract covering 100 companies. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn aggregate, we received premiums of $3.4 billion for these contracts. When I originally told you in \\r\\nour 2007 Annual Report about them, I said that I expected the contracts would deliver us an \"underwriting \\r\\nprofit,\" meaning that our losses would be less than the premiums we received. In addition, I said we would \\r\\nbenefit from the use of float. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n19 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSubsequently, as you know too well, we encountered both a financial panic and a severe recession. A \\r\\nnumber of the companies in the high-yield indices failed, which required us to pay losses of $2.5 billion. Today, \\r\\nhowever, our exposure is largely behind us because most of our higher-risk contracts have expired. Consequently, it \\r\\nappears almost certain that we will earn an underwriting profit as we originally anticipated. In addition, we have had \\r\\nthe use of interest-free float that averaged about $2 billion over the life of the contracts. In short, we charged the \\r\\nright premium, and that protected us when business conditions turned terrible three years ago. \\r\\n\\r\\nOur other large derivatives position - whose contracts go by the name of \"equity puts\" - involves \\r\\ninsurance we wrote for parties wishing to protect themselves against a possible decline in equity prices in the \\r\\nU.S., U.K., Europe and Japan. These contracts are tied to various equity indices, such as the S&P 500 in the U.S. \\r\\nand the FTSE 100 in the U.K. In the 2004-2008 period, we received $4.8 billion of premiums for 47 of these \\r\\ncontracts, most of which ran for 15 years. On these contracts, only the price of the indices on the termination date \\r\\ncounts: No payments can be required before then. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs a first step in updating you about these contracts, I can report that late in 2010, at the instigation of \\r\\nour counterparty, we unwound eight contracts, all of them due between 2021 and 2028. We had originally \\r\\nreceived $647 million in premiums for these contracts, and the unwinding required us to pay $425 million. \\r\\nConsequently, we realized a gain of $222 million and also had the interest-free and unrestricted use of that \\r\\n$647 million for about three years. \\r\\n\\r\\nThose 2010 transactions left us with 39 equity put contracts remaining on our books at yearend. On \\r\\nthese, at their initiation, we received premiums of $4.2 billion. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe future of these contracts is, of course, uncertain. But here is one perspective on them. If the prices \\r\\nof the relevant indices are the same at the contract expiration dates as these prices were on December 31, 2010 - \\r\\nand foreign exchange rates are unchanged - we would owe $3.8 billion on expirations occurring from 2018 to \\r\\n2026. You can call this amount \"settlement value.\" \\r\\n\\r\\nOn our yearend balance sheet, however, we carry the liability for those remaining equity puts at \\r\\n$6.7 billion. In other words, if the prices of the relevant indices remain unchanged from that date, we will record \\r\\na $2.9 billion gain in the years to come, that being the difference between the liability figure of $6.7 billion and \\r\\nthe settlement value of $3.8 billion. I believe that equity prices will very likely increase and that our liability will \\r\\nfall significantly between now and settlement date. If so, our gain from this point will be even greater. But that, \\r\\nof course, is far from a sure thing. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhat is sure is that we will have the use of our remaining \"float\" of $4.2 billion for an average of about \\r\\n10 more years. (Neither this float nor that arising from the high-yield contracts is included in the insurance float \\r\\nfigure of $66 billion.) Since money is fungible, think of a portion of these funds as contributing to the purchase \\r\\nof BNSF. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs I have told you before, almost all of our derivatives contracts are free of any obligation to post \\r\\ncollateral - a fact that cut the premiums we could otherwise have charged. But that fact also left us feeling \\r\\ncomfortable during the financial crisis, allowing us in those days to commit to some advantageous purchases. \\r\\nForegoing some additional derivatives premiums proved to be well worth it. \\r\\n\\r\\nOn Reporting and Misreporting: The Numbers That Count and Those That Don\\'t \\r\\n\\r\\nEarlier in this letter, I pointed out some numbers that Charlie and I find useful in valuing Berkshire and \\r\\nmeasuring its progress. \\r\\n\\r\\nLet\\'s focus here on a number we omitted, but which many in the media feature above all others: net \\r\\nincome. Important though that number may be at most companies, it is almost always meaningless at Berkshire. \\r\\nRegardless of how our businesses might be doing, Charlie and I could - quite legally - cause net income in any \\r\\ngiven period to be almost any number we would like. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n20 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have that flexibility because realized gains or losses on investments go into the net income figure, \\r\\nwhereas unrealized gains (and, in most cases, losses) are excluded. For example, imagine that Berkshire had a \\r\\n$10 billion increase in unrealized gains in a given year and concurrently had $1 billion of realized losses. Our net \\r\\nincome - which would count only the loss - would be reported as less than our operating income. If we had \\r\\nmeanwhile realized gains in the previous year, headlines might proclaim that our earnings were down X% when \\r\\nin reality our business might be much improved. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf we really thought net income important, we could regularly feed realized gains into it simply because \\r\\nwe have a huge amount of unrealized gains upon which to draw. Rest assured, though, that Charlie and I have \\r\\nnever sold a security because of the effect a sale would have on the net income we were soon to report. We both \\r\\nhave a deep disgust for \"game playing\" with numbers, a practice that was rampant throughout corporate America \\r\\nin the 1990s and still persists, though it occurs less frequently and less blatantly than it used to. \\r\\n\\r\\nOperating earnings, despite having some shortcomings, are in general a reasonable guide as to how our \\r\\nbusinesses are doing. Ignore our net income figure, however. Regulations require that we report it to you. But if \\r\\nyou find reporters focusing on it, that will speak more to their performance than ours. \\r\\n\\r\\nBoth realized and unrealized gains and losses are fully reflected in the calculation of our book value. \\r\\nPay attention to the changes in that metric and to the course of our operating earnings, and you will be on the \\r\\nright track. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs a p.s., I can\\'t resist pointing out just how capricious reported net income can be. Had our equity puts \\r\\nhad a termination date of June 30, 2010, we would have been required to pay $6.4 billion to our counterparties at \\r\\nthat date. Security prices then generally rose in the next quarter, a move that brought the corresponding figure \\r\\ndown to $5.8 billion on September 30th. Yet the Black-Scholes formula that we use in valuing these contracts \\r\\nrequired us to increase our balance-sheet liability during this period from $8.9 billion to $9.6 billion, a change \\r\\nthat, after the effect of tax accruals, reduced our net income for the quarter by $455 million. \\r\\n\\r\\nBoth Charlie and I believe that Black-Scholes produces wildly inappropriate values when applied to \\r\\nlong-dated options. We set out one absurd example in these pages two years ago. More tangibly, we put our \\r\\nmoney where our mouth was by entering into our equity put contracts. By doing so, we implicitly asserted that \\r\\nthe Black-Scholes calculations used by our counterparties or their customers were faulty. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe continue, nevertheless, to use that formula in presenting our financial statements. Black-Scholes is \\r\\nthe accepted standard for option valuation - almost all leading business schools teach it - and we would be \\r\\naccused of shoddy accounting if we deviated from it. Moreover, we would present our auditors with an \\r\\ninsurmountable problem were we to do that: They have clients who are our counterparties and who use Black- \\r\\nScholes values for the same contracts we hold. It would be impossible for our auditors to attest to the accuracy of \\r\\nboth their values and ours were the two far apart. \\r\\n\\r\\nPart of the appeal of Black-Scholes to auditors and regulators is that it produces a precise number. \\r\\nCharlie and I can\\'t supply one of those. We believe the true liability of our contracts to be far lower than that \\r\\ncalculated by Black-Scholes, but we can\\'t come up with an exact figure - anymore than we can come up with a \\r\\nprecise value for GEICO, BNSF, or for Berkshire Hathaway itself. Our inability to pinpoint a number doesn\\'t \\r\\nbother us: We would rather be approximately right than precisely wrong. \\r\\n\\r\\nJohn Kenneth Galbraith once slyly observed that economists were most economical with ideas: They \\r\\nmade the ones learned in graduate school last a lifetime. University finance departments often behave similarly. \\r\\nWitness the tenacity with which almost all clung to the theory of efficient markets throughout the 1970s and \\r\\n1980s, dismissively calling powerful facts that refuted it \"anomalies.\" (I always love explanations of that kind: \\r\\nThe Flat Earth Society probably views a ship\\'s circling of the globe as an annoying, but inconsequential, \\r\\nanomaly.) \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n21 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAcademics\\' current practice of teaching Black-Scholes as revealed truth needs re-examination. For that \\r\\nmatter, so does the academic\\'s inclination to dwell on the valuation of options. You can be highly successful as \\r\\nan investor without having the slightest ability to value an option. What students should be learning is how to \\r\\nvalue a business. That\\'s what investing is all about. \\r\\n\\r\\nLife and Debt \\r\\n\\r\\nThe fundamental principle of auto racing is that to finish first, you must first finish. That dictum is \\r\\nequally applicable to business and guides our every action at Berkshire. \\r\\n\\r\\nUnquestionably, some people have become very rich through the use of borrowed money. However, \\r\\nthat\\'s also been a way to get very poor. When leverage works, it magnifies your gains. Your spouse thinks you\\'re \\r\\nclever, and your neighbors get envious. But leverage is addictive. Once having profited from its wonders, very \\r\\nfew people retreat to more conservative practices. And as we all learned in third grade - and some relearned in \\r\\n2008 - any series of positive numbers, however impressive the numbers may be, evaporates when multiplied by a \\r\\nsingle zero. History tells us that leverage all too often produces zeroes, even when it is employed by very smart \\r\\npeople. \\r\\n\\r\\nLeverage, of course, can be lethal to businesses as well. Companies with large debts often assume that \\r\\nthese obligations can be refinanced as they mature. That assumption is usually valid. Occasionally, though, either \\r\\nbecause of company-specific problems or a worldwide shortage of credit, maturities must actually be met by \\r\\npayment. For that, only cash will do the job. \\r\\n\\r\\nBorrowers then learn that credit is like oxygen. When either is abundant, its presence goes unnoticed. \\r\\nWhen either is missing, that\\'s all that is noticed. Even a short absence of credit can bring a company to its knees. \\r\\nIn September 2008, in fact, its overnight disappearance in many sectors of the economy came dangerously close \\r\\nto bringing our entire country to its knees. \\r\\n\\r\\nCharlie and I have no interest in any activity that could pose the slightest threat to Berkshire\\'s well- \\r\\nbeing. (With our having a combined age of 167, starting over is not on our bucket list.) We are forever conscious \\r\\nof the fact that you, our partners, have entrusted us with what in many cases is a major portion of your savings. In \\r\\naddition, important philanthropy is dependent on our prudence. Finally, many disabled victims of accidents \\r\\ncaused by our insureds are counting on us to deliver sums payable decades from now. It would be irresponsible \\r\\nfor us to risk what all these constituencies need just to pursue a few points of extra return. \\r\\n\\r\\nA little personal history may partially explain our extreme aversion to financial adventurism. I didn\\'t \\r\\nmeet Charlie until he was 35, though he grew up within 100 yards of where I have lived for 52 years and also \\r\\nattended the same inner-city public high school in Omaha from which my father, wife, children and two \\r\\ngrandchildren graduated. Charlie and I did, however, both work as young boys at my grandfather\\'s grocery store, \\r\\nthough our periods of employment were separated by about five years. My grandfather\\'s name was Ernest, and \\r\\nperhaps no man was more aptly named. No one worked for Ernest, even as a stock boy, without being shaped by \\r\\nthe experience. \\r\\n\\r\\nOn the facing page you can read a letter sent in 1939 by Ernest to his youngest son, my Uncle Fred. \\r\\nSimilar letters went to his other four children. I still have the letter sent to my Aunt Alice, which I found - along \\r\\nwith $1,000 of cash - when, as executor of her estate, I opened her safe deposit box in 1970. \\r\\n\\r\\nErnest never went to business school - he never in fact finished high school - but he understood the \\r\\nimportance of liquidity as a condition for assured survival. At Berkshire, we have taken his $1,000 solution a bit \\r\\nfurther and have pledged that we will hold at least $10 billion of cash, excluding that held at our regulated utility \\r\\nand railroad businesses. Because of that commitment, we customarily keep at least $20 billion on hand so that we \\r\\ncan both withstand unprecedented insurance losses (our largest to date having been about $3 billion from Katrina, \\r\\nthe insurance industry\\'s most expensive catastrophe) and quickly seize acquisition or investment opportunities, \\r\\neven during times of financial turmoil. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n22 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDear Fred & Catherine: \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOver a period of a good many years I have known a great many \\r\\npeople who at some time or another have suffered in various ways \\r\\nsimply because they did not have ready cash. I have known people \\r\\nwho have had to sacrifice some of their holdings in order to have \\r\\nmoney that was necessary at that time* \\r\\n\\r\\nFor a good many years your grandfather kept a certain amount \\r\\nof money where he could put his hands on It In very short notice* \\r\\n\\r\\nFor a number of years I have made it a point to keep a reserve, \\r\\nshould some occasion come up where I would need money quickly, with- \\r\\nout disturbing the money that I have in my business. There have \\r\\nbeen a couple occasions when I found it very convenient to go to \\r\\nthis fund* \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThus, I feel that everyone should have a reserve. I hope it \\r\\nnever happens to you, but the chances are that some day you v/111 \\r\\nneed money, and need it badly, and with this thought in view, I \\r\\nstarted a fund by placing $SQO,00 in an envelope,with your name on \\r\\nit, when you were married. Each year I added something to it, until \\r\\nthere is now $1000.00 in the fund* \\r\\n\\r\\nTen years have elapsed since you were married, and this fund \\r\\nis now completed* \\r\\n\\r\\nIt Is my wish that you place this envelope in your safety \\r\\ndeposit box, and keep it for the purpose that it was created, for. \\r\\nShould the time come when you need part, I wohld suggest that you \\r\\nuse as little as possible, and replace it as soon as possible* \\r\\n\\r\\nYou might feel that this should be invested and bring you an \\r\\nincome. Forget it — the mental satisfaction of having $1000*00 \\r\\nlaid away where you can put your hands on it, is worth more than \\r\\nwhat interest it might bring, especially if you have the investment \\r\\nin something that you could not realize on quickly* \\r\\n\\r\\nIf in after years you feel this has been a good idea, you \\r\\nmight repeat it with your own ohildren* \\r\\n\\r\\nFor your information, I might mention that there has never \\r\\nbeen a Buffett who ever left a very large estate, but there has \\r\\nnever been one that did not leave something* They never spent all \\r\\nthey made, but always saved part of what they made, and it has all \\r\\nworked out pretty well* \\r\\n\\r\\nThis letter is being written at the expiration of ten years \\r\\nafter you were married* \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n23 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWe keep our cash largely in U.S. Treasury bills and avoid other short-term securities yielding a few \\r\\nmore basis points, a policy we adhered to long before the frailties of commercial paper and money market funds \\r\\nbecame apparent in September 2008. We agree with investment writer Ray DeVoe\\'s observation, \"More money \\r\\nhas been lost reaching for yield than at the point of a gun.\" At Berkshire, we don\\'t rely on bank lines, and we \\r\\ndon\\'t enter into contracts that could require postings of collateral except for amounts that are tiny in relation to \\r\\nour liquid assets. \\r\\n\\r\\nFurthermore, not a dime of cash has left Berkshire for dividends or share repurchases during the past \\r\\n40 years. Instead, we have retained all of our earnings to strengthen our business, a reinforcement now running \\r\\nabout $1 billion per month. Our net worth has thus increased from $48 million to $157 billion during those four \\r\\ndecades and our intrinsic value has grown far more. No other American corporation has come close to building \\r\\nup its financial strength in this unrelenting way. \\r\\n\\r\\nBy being so cautious in respect to leverage, we penalize our returns by a minor amount. Having loads of \\r\\nliquidity, though, lets us sleep well. Moreover, during the episodes of financial chaos that occasionally erupt in our \\r\\neconomy, we will be equipped both financially and emotionally to play offense while others scramble for survival. \\r\\nThat\\'s what allowed us to invest $15.6 billion in 25 days of panic following the Lehman bankruptcy in 2008. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Annual Meeting \\r\\n\\r\\nThe annual meeting will be held on Saturday, April 30 th . Carrie Kizer from our home office will be the \\r\\nringmaster, and her theme this year is Planes, Trains and Automobiles. This gives NetJets, BNSF and BYD a \\r\\nchance to show off. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs always, the doors will open at the Qwest Center at 7 a.m., and a new Berkshire movie will be shown at \\r\\n8:30. At 9:30 we will go directly to the question-and-answer period, which (with a break for lunch at the Qwest\\' s \\r\\nstands) will last until 3:30. After a short recess, Charlie and I will convene the annual meeting at 3:45. If you decide \\r\\nto leave during the day\\'s question periods, please do so while Charlie is talking. (Act fast; he can be terse.) \\r\\n\\r\\nThe best reason to exit, of course, is to shop. We will help you do that by filling the 194,300-square- \\r\\nfoot hall that adjoins the meeting area with products from dozens of Berkshire subsidiaries. Last year, you did \\r\\nyour part, and most locations racked up record sales. In a nine-hour period, we sold 1,053 pairs of Justin boots, \\r\\n12,416 pounds of See\\'s candy, 8,000 Dairy Queen Blizzards® and 8,800 Quikut knives (that\\'s 16 knives per \\r\\nminute). But you can do better. Remember: Anyone who says money can\\'t buy happiness simply hasn\\'t learned \\r\\nwhere to shop. \\r\\n\\r\\nGEICO will have a booth staffed by a number of its top counselors from around the country, all of \\r\\nthem ready to supply you with auto insurance quotes. In most cases, GEICO will be able to give you a \\r\\nshareholder discount (usually 8%). This special offer is permitted by 44 of the 51 jurisdictions in which we \\r\\noperate. (One supplemental point: The discount is not additive if you qualify for another, such as that given \\r\\ncertain groups.) Bring the details of your existing insurance and check out whether we can save you money. For \\r\\nat least half of you, I believe we can. \\r\\n\\r\\nBe sure to visit the Bookworm. It will carry more than 60 books and DVDs, including the Chinese \\r\\nlanguage edition of Poor Charlie\\'s Almanack, the ever-popular book about my partner. So what if you can\\'t read \\r\\nChinese? Just buy a copy and carry it around; it will make you look urbane and erudite. Should you need to ship \\r\\nyour book purchases, a shipping service will be available nearby. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf you are a big spender - or merely a gawker - visit Elliott Aviation on the east side of the Omaha \\r\\nairport between noon and 5:00 p.m. on Saturday. There we will have a fleet of NetJets aircraft that will get your \\r\\npulse racing. Come by bus; leave by private jet. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n24 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAn attachment to the proxy material that is enclosed with this report explains how you can obtain the \\r\\ncredential you will need for admission to the meeting and other events. As for plane, hotel and car reservations, \\r\\nwe have again signed up American Express (800-799-6634) to give you special help. Carol Pedersen, who \\r\\nhandles these matters, does a terrific job for us each year, and I thank her for it. Hotel rooms can be hard to find, \\r\\nbut work with Carol and you will get one. \\r\\n\\r\\nAirlines have often jacked up prices - sometimes dramatically so - for the Berkshire weekend. If you \\r\\nare coming from far away, compare the cost of flying to Kansas City versus Omaha. The drive is about 2 Vi hours \\r\\nand it may be that you can save significant money, particularly if you had planned to rent a car in Omaha. \\r\\n\\r\\nAt Nebraska Furniture Mart, located on a 77-acre site on 72 nd Street between Dodge and Pacific, we \\r\\nwill again be having \"Berkshire Weekend\" discount pricing. Last year the store did $33.3 million of business \\r\\nduring its annual meeting sale, a volume that - as far as I know - exceeds the one-week total of any retail store \\r\\nanyplace. To obtain the Berkshire discount, you must make your purchases between Tuesday, April 26 th and \\r\\nMonday, May 2 nd inclusive, and also present your meeting credential. The period\\'s special pricing will even \\r\\napply to the products of several prestigious manufacturers that normally have ironclad rules against \\r\\ndiscounting but which, in the spirit of our shareholder weekend, have made an exception for you. \\r\\nWe appreciate their cooperation. NFM is open from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday through Saturday, and 10 a.m. \\r\\nto 6 p.m. on Sunday. On Saturday this year, from 5:30 p.m. to 8 p.m., NFM is having a picnic to which you are \\r\\nall invited. \\r\\n\\r\\nAt Borsheims, we will again have two shareholder-only events. The first will be a cocktail reception \\r\\nfrom 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. on Friday, April 29 th . The second, the main gala, will be held on Sunday, May 1 st , from \\r\\n9 a.m. to 4 p.m. On Saturday, we will be open until 6 p.m. On Sunday, around 1 p.m., I will be at Borsheims \\r\\nwith a smile and a shoeshine, selling jewelry just as I sold men\\'s shirts at J.C. Penney\\'s 63 years ago. \\r\\nFve told Susan Jacques, Borsheims\\' CEO, that I\\'m still a hotshot salesman. But I see doubt in her eyes. \\r\\nSo cut loose and buy something from me for your wife or sweetheart (presumably the same person). Make me \\r\\nlook good. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe will have huge crowds at Borsheims throughout the weekend. For your convenience, therefore, \\r\\nshareholder prices will be available from Monday, April 25 lh through Saturday, May 7 th . During that period, \\r\\nplease identify yourself as a shareholder by presenting your meeting credentials or a brokerage statement that \\r\\nshows you are a Berkshire shareholder. \\r\\n\\r\\nOn Sunday, in the mall outside of Borsheims, a blindfolded Patrick Wolff, twice U.S. chess champion, \\r\\nwill take on all comers - who will have their eyes wide open - in groups of six. Nearby, Norman Beck, a \\r\\nremarkable magician from Dallas, will bewilder onlookers. Additionally, we will have Bob Hamman and Sharon \\r\\nOsberg, two of the world\\'s top bridge experts, available to play bridge with our shareholders on Sunday \\r\\nafternoon. \\r\\n\\r\\nGorat\\'s and Piccolo\\'s will again be open exclusively for Berkshire shareholders on Sunday, May 1 st . \\r\\nBoth will be serving until 10 p.m., with Gorat\\'s opening at 1 p.m. and Piccolo\\'s opening at 4 p.m. These \\r\\nrestaurants are my favorites and - still being a growing boy - I will eat at both of them on Sunday evening. \\r\\nRemember: To make a reservation at Gorat\\'s, call 402-551-3733 on April 1 st (but not before) and at Piccolo\\'s \\r\\ncall 402-342-9038. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe will again have the same three financial journalists lead the question-and-answer period, asking \\r\\nCharlie and me questions that shareholders have submitted to them by e-mail. The journalists and their e-mail \\r\\naddresses are: Carol Loomis, of Fortune, who may be emailed at cloomis@fortunemail.com; Becky Quick, of \\r\\nCNBC, at BerkshireQuestions@cnbc.com, and Andrew Ross Sorkin, of The New York Times, at \\r\\narsorkin @ nytimes.com. \\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the questions submitted, each journalist will choose the dozen or so he or she decides are the \\r\\nmost interesting and important. The journalists have told me your question has the best chance of being selected \\r\\nif you keep it concise, avoid sending it in at the last moment, make it Berkshire-related and include no more than \\r\\ntwo questions in any email you send them. (In your email, let the journalist know if you would like your name \\r\\nmentioned if your question is selected.) \\r\\n\\r\\nNeither Charlie nor I will get so much as a clue about the questions to be asked. We know the \\r\\njournalists will pick some tough ones, and that\\'s the way we like it. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n25 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWe will again have a drawing at 8:15 a.m. on Saturday at each of 13 microphones for those \\r\\nshareholders wishing to ask questions themselves. At the meeting, I will alternate the questions asked by the \\r\\njournalists with those from the winning shareholders. We hope to answer at least 60 questions. From our \\r\\nstandpoint, the more the better. Our goal, which we pursue both through these annual letters and by our meeting \\r\\ndiscussions, is to give you a better understanding of the business that you own. \\r\\n\\r\\nFor good reason, I regularly extol the accomplishments of our operating managers. Equally important, \\r\\nhowever, are the 20 men and women who work with me at our corporate office (all on one floor, which is the \\r\\nway we intend to keep it!). \\r\\n\\r\\nThis group efficiently deals with a multitude of SEC and other regulatory requirements, files a 14,097- \\r\\npage Federal income tax return along with state and foreign returns, responds to countless shareholder and media \\r\\ninquiries, gets out the annual report, prepares for the country\\'s largest annual meeting, coordinates the Board\\'s \\r\\nactivities - and the list goes on and on. \\r\\n\\r\\nThey handle all of these business tasks cheerfully and with unbelievable efficiency, making my life \\r\\neasy and joyful. Their efforts go beyond activities strictly related to Berkshire: They deal with 48 universities \\r\\n(selected from 200 applicants) who will send students to Omaha this school year for a day with me and also \\r\\nhandle all kinds of requests that I receive, arrange my travel, and even get me hamburgers for lunch. No CEO has \\r\\nit better. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis home office crew has my deepest thanks and deserves yours as well. Come to our Woodstock for \\r\\nCapitalism on April 30 th and tell them so. \\r\\n\\r\\nFebruary 26, 20 1 1 Warren E. Buffett \\r\\n\\r\\nChairman of the Board \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n26 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMemo \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo: Berkshire Hathaway Managers (\"The All-Stars\") \\r\\ncc: Berkshire Directors \\r\\nFrom: Warren E. Buffett \\r\\nDate: July 26, 2010 \\r\\n\\r\\nThis is my biennial letter to reemphasize Berkshire\\'s top priority and to get your help on \\r\\nsuccession planning (yours, not mine!). \\r\\n\\r\\nThe priority is that all of us continue to zealously guard Berkshire\\'s reputation. We can\\'t be \\r\\nperfect but we can try to be. As I\\'ve said in these memos for more than 25 years: \"We can afford to lose \\r\\nmoney - even a lot of money. But we can\\'t afford to lose reputation - even a shred of reputation.\" We \\r\\nmust continue to measure every act against not only what is legal but also what we would be happy to have \\r\\nwritten about on the front page of a national newspaper in an article written by an unfriendly but intelligent \\r\\nreporter. \\r\\n\\r\\nSometimes your associates will say \"Everybody else is doing it.\" This rationale is almost always \\r\\na bad one if it is the main justification for a business action. It is totally unacceptable when evaluating a \\r\\nmoral decision. Whenever somebody offers that phrase as a rationale, in effect they are saying that they \\r\\ncan\\'t come up with a good reason. If anyone gives this explanation, tell them to try using it with a reporter \\r\\nor a judge and see how far it gets them. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf you see anything whose propriety or legality causes you to hesitate, be sure to give me a call. \\r\\nHowever, it\\'s very likely that if a given course of action evokes such hesitation, it\\'s too close to the line \\r\\nand should be abandoned. There\\'s plenty of money to be made in the center of the court. If it\\'s \\r\\nquestionable whether some action is close to the line, just assume it is outside and forget it. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs a corollary, let me know promptly if there\\'s any significant bad news. I can handle bad news \\r\\nbut I don\\'t like to deal with it after it has festered for awhile. A reluctance to face up immediately to bad \\r\\nnews is what turned a problem at Salomon from one that could have easily been disposed of into one that \\r\\nalmost caused the demise of a firm with 8,000 employees. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n104 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSomebody is doing something today at Berkshire that you and I would be unhappy about if we \\r\\nknew of it. That\\'s inevitable: We now employ more than 250,000 people and the chances of that number \\r\\ngetting through the day without any bad behavior occurring is nil. But we can have a huge effect in \\r\\nminimizing such activities by jumping on anything immediately when there is the slightest odor of \\r\\nimpropriety. Your attitude on such matters, expressed by behavior as well as words, will be the most \\r\\nimportant factor in how the culture of your business develops. Culture, more than rule books, determines \\r\\nhow an organization behaves. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn other respects, talk to me about what is going on as little or as much as you wish. Each of you \\r\\ndoes a first-class job of running your operation with your own individual style and you don\\'t need me to \\r\\nhelp. The only items you need to clear with me are any changes in post-retirement benefits and any \\r\\nunusually large capital expenditures or acquisitions. \\r\\n\\r\\nI need your help in respect to the question of succession. I\\'m not looking for any of you to retire \\r\\nand I hope you all live to 100. (In Charlie\\'s case, 1 10.) But just in case you don\\'t, please send me a letter \\r\\n(at home if you wish) giving your recommendation as who should take over tomorrow if you should \\r\\nbecome incapacitated overnight. These letters will be seen by no one but me unless I\\'m no longer CEO, in \\r\\nwhich case my successor will need the information. Please summarize the strengths and weaknesses of \\r\\nyour primary candidate as well as any possible alternates you may wish to include. Most of you have \\r\\nparticipated in this exercise in the past and others have offered your ideas verbally. However, it\\'s \\r\\nimportant to me to get a periodic update, and now that we have added so many businesses, I need to have \\r\\nyour thoughts in writing rather than trying to carry them around in my memory. Of course, there are a few \\r\\noperations that are run by two or more of you - such as the Blumkins, the Merschmans, the pair at Applied \\r\\nUnderwriters, etc. - and in these cases, just forget about this item. Your note can be short, informal, \\r\\nhandwritten, etc. Just mark it \"Personal for Warren.\" \\r\\n\\r\\nThanks for your help on all of this. And thanks for the way you run your businesses. You make \\r\\nmy job easy. \\r\\n\\r\\nWEB/db \\r\\n\\r\\nP.S. Another minor request: Please turn down all proposals for me to speak, make contributions, intercede \\r\\nwith the Gates Foundation, etc. Sometimes these requests for you to act as intermediary will be \\r\\naccompanied by \"It can\\'t hurt to ask.\" It will be easier for both of us if you just say \"no.\" As an added \\r\\nfavor, don\\'t suggest that they instead write or call me. Multiply 76 businesses by the periodic \"I think he\\'ll \\r\\nbe interested in this one\" and you can understand why it is better to say no firmly and immediately. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n105 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.: \\r\\n\\r\\nThe per-share book value of both our Class A and Class B stock increased by 4.6% in 2011. Over the \\r\\nlast 47 years (that is, since present management took over), book value has grown from $19 to $99,860, a rate of \\r\\n19.8% compounded annually.* \\r\\n\\r\\nCharlie Munger, Berkshire\\'s Vice Chairman and my partner, and I feel good about the company\\'s \\r\\nprogress during 201 1. Here are the highlights: \\r\\n\\r\\n• The primary job of a Board of Directors is to see that the right people are running the business and to \\r\\nbe sure that the next generation of leaders is identified and ready to take over tomorrow. I have been on \\r\\n19 corporate boards, and Berkshire\\'s directors are at the top of the list in the time and diligence they \\r\\nhave devoted to succession planning. What\\'s more, their efforts have paid off. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs 2011 started, Todd Combs joined us as an investment manager, and shortly after yearend Ted \\r\\nWeschler came aboard. Both of these men have outstanding investment skills and a deep commitment \\r\\nto Berkshire. Each will be handling a few billion dollars in 2012, but they have the brains, judgment \\r\\nand character to manage our entire portfolio when Charlie and I are no longer running Berkshire. \\r\\n\\r\\nYour Board is equally enthusiastic about my successor as CEO, an individual to whom they have had a \\r\\ngreat deal of exposure and whose managerial and human qualities they admire. (We have two superb \\r\\nback-up candidates as well.) When a transfer of responsibility is required, it will be seamless, and \\r\\nBerkshire\\'s prospects will remain bright. More than 98% of my net worth is in Berkshire stock, all of \\r\\nwhich will go to various philanthropies. Being so heavily concentrated in one stock defies conventional \\r\\nwisdom. But I\\'m fine with this arrangement, knowing both the quality and diversity of the businesses \\r\\nwe own and the caliber of the people who manage them. With these assets, my successor will enjoy a \\r\\nrunning start. Do not, however, infer from this discussion that Charlie and I are going anywhere; we \\r\\ncontinue to be in excellent health, and we love what we do. \\r\\n\\r\\n• On September 16 th we acquired Lubrizol, a worldwide producer of additives and other specialty \\r\\nchemicals. The company has had an outstanding record since James Hambrick became CEO in 2004, \\r\\nwith pre-tax profits increasing from $147 million to $1,085 million. Lubrizol will have many \\r\\nopportunities for \"bolt-on\" acquisitions in the specialty chemical field. Indeed, we\\'ve already agreed to \\r\\nthree, costing $493 million. James is a disciplined buyer and a superb operator. Charlie and I are eager \\r\\nto expand his managerial domain. \\r\\n\\r\\n• Our major businesses did well last year. In fact, each of our five largest non-insurance companies - BNSF, \\r\\nIscar, Lubrizol, Marmon Group and MidAmerican Energy - delivered record operating earnings. In \\r\\naggregate these businesses earned more than $9 billion pre-tax in 2011. Contrast that to seven years ago, \\r\\nwhen we owned only one of the five, MidAmerican, whose pre-tax earnings were $393 million. Unless the \\r\\neconomy weakens in 2012, each of our fabulous five should again set a record, with aggregate earnings \\r\\ncomfortably topping $10 billion. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n* All per-share figures used in this report apply to Berkshire\\'s A shares. Figures for the B shares are \\r\\n1/1 500 th of those shown for A. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n3 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn total, our entire string of operating companies spent $8.2 billion for property, plant and equipment in \\r\\n2011, smashing our previous record by more than $2 billion. About 95% of these outlays were made in \\r\\nthe U.S., a fact that may surprise those who believe our country lacks investment opportunities. We \\r\\nwelcome projects abroad, but expect the overwhelming majority of Berkshire\\'s future capital \\r\\ncommitments to be in America. In 2012, these expenditures will again set a record. \\r\\n\\r\\nOur insurance operations continued their delivery of costless capital that funds a myriad of other \\r\\nopportunities. This business produces \"float\" - money that doesn\\'t belong to us, but that we get to \\r\\ninvest for Berkshire\\'s benefit. And if we pay out less in losses and expenses than we receive in \\r\\npremiums, we additionally earn an underwriting profit, meaning the float costs us less than nothing. \\r\\nThough we are sure to have underwriting losses from time to time, we\\'ve now had nine consecutive \\r\\nyears of underwriting profits, totaling about $17 billion. Over the same nine years our float increased \\r\\nfrom $41 billion to its current record of $70 billion. Insurance has been good to us. \\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, we made two major investments in marketable securities: (1) a $5 billion 6% preferred stock of \\r\\nBank of America that came with warrants allowing us to buy 700 million common shares at $7.14 per \\r\\nshare any time before September 2, 2021; and (2) 63.9 million shares of IBM that cost us $10.9 billion. \\r\\nCounting IBM, we now have large ownership interests in four exceptional companies: 13.0% of \\r\\nAmerican Express, 8.8% of Coca-Cola, 5.5% of IBM and 7.6% of Wells Fargo. (We also, of course, \\r\\nhave many smaller, but important, positions.) \\r\\n\\r\\nWe view these holdings as partnership interests in wonderful businesses, not as marketable securities to \\r\\nbe bought or sold based on their near-term prospects. Our share of their earnings, however, are far from \\r\\nfully reflected in our earnings; only the dividends we receive from these businesses show up in our \\r\\nfinancial reports. Over time, though, the undistributed earnings of these companies that are attributable \\r\\nto our ownership are of huge importance to us. That\\'s because they will be used in a variety of ways to \\r\\nincrease future earnings and dividends of the investee. They may also be devoted to stock repurchases, \\r\\nwhich will increase our share of the company\\'s future earnings. \\r\\n\\r\\nHad we owned our present positions throughout last year, our dividends from the \"Big Four\" would \\r\\nhave been $862 million. That\\'s all that would have been reported in Berkshire\\'s income statement. Our \\r\\nshare of this quartet\\'s earnings, however, would have been far greater: $3.3 billion. Charlie and I \\r\\nbelieve that the $2.4 billion that goes unreported on our books creates at least that amount of value for \\r\\nBerkshire as it fuels earnings gains in future years. We expect the combined earnings of the four - and \\r\\ntheir dividends as well - to increase in 2012 and, for that matter, almost every year for a long time to \\r\\ncome. A decade from now, our current holdings of the four companies might well account for earnings \\r\\nof $7 billion, of which $2 billion in dividends would come to us. \\r\\n\\r\\nI\\'ve run out of good news. Here are some developments that hurt us during 201 1: \\r\\n\\r\\nA few years back, I spent about $2 billion buying several bond issues of Energy Future Holdings, an \\r\\nelectric utility operation serving portions of Texas. That was a mistake - a big mistake. In large measure, \\r\\nthe company\\'s prospects were tied to the price of natural gas, which tanked shortly after our purchase and \\r\\nremains depressed. Though we have annually received interest payments of about $102 million since our \\r\\npurchase, the company\\'s ability to pay will soon be exhausted unless gas prices rise substantially. We \\r\\nwrote down our investment by $1 billion in 2010 and by an additional $390 million last year. \\r\\n\\r\\nAt yearend, we carried the bonds at their market value of $878 million. If gas prices remain at present \\r\\nlevels, we will likely face a further loss, perhaps in an amount that will virtually wipe out our current \\r\\ncarrying value. Conversely, a substantial increase in gas prices might allow us to recoup some, or even \\r\\nall, of our write-down. However things turn out, I totally miscalculated the gain/loss probabilities when \\r\\nI purchased the bonds. In tennis parlance, this was a major unforced error by your chairman. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n4 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n• Three large and very attractive fixed-income investments were called away from us by their issuers in \\r\\n2011. Swiss Re, Goldman Sachs and General Electric paid us an aggregate of $12.8 billion to redeem \\r\\nsecurities that were producing about $1.2 billion of pre-tax earnings for Berkshire. That\\'s a lot of \\r\\nincome to replace, though our Lubrizol purchase did offset most of it. \\r\\n\\r\\n• Last year, I told you that \"a housing recovery will probably begin within a year or so.\" I was dead \\r\\nwrong. We have five businesses whose results are significantly influenced by housing activity. The \\r\\nconnection is direct at Clayton Homes, which is the largest producer of homes in the country, \\r\\naccounting for about 7% of those constructed during 201 1. \\r\\n\\r\\nAdditionally, Acme Brick, Shaw (carpet), Johns Manville (insulation) and MiTek (building products, \\r\\nprimarily connector plates used in roofing) are all materially affected by construction activity. In \\r\\naggregate, our five housing-related companies had pre-tax profits of $513 million in 2011. That\\'s \\r\\nsimilar to 2010 but down from $1.8 billion in 2006. \\r\\n\\r\\nHousing will come back - you can be sure of that. Over time, the number of housing units necessarily \\r\\nmatches the number of households (after allowing for a normal level of vacancies). For a period of \\r\\nyears prior to 2008, however, America added more housing units than households. Inevitably, we \\r\\nended up with far too many units and the bubble popped with a violence that shook the entire economy. \\r\\nThat created still another problem for housing: Early in a recession, household formations slow, and in \\r\\n2009 the decrease was dramatic. \\r\\n\\r\\nThat devastating supply/demand equation is now reversed: Every day we are creating more households \\r\\nthan housing units. People may postpone hitching up during uncertain times, but eventually hormones \\r\\ntake over. And while \"doubling-up\" may be the initial reaction of some during a recession, living with \\r\\nin-laws can quickly lose its allure. \\r\\n\\r\\nAt our current annual pace of 600,000 housing starts - considerably less than the number of new \\r\\nhouseholds being formed - buyers and renters are sopping up what\\'s left of the old oversupply. (This \\r\\nprocess will run its course at different rates around the country; the supply-demand situation varies \\r\\nwidely by locale.) While this healing takes place, however, our housing-related companies sputter, \\r\\nemploying only 43,315 people compared to 58,769 in 2006. This hugely important sector of the \\r\\neconomy, which includes not only construction but everything that feeds off of it, remains in a \\r\\ndepression of its own. I believe this is the major reason a recovery in employment has so severely \\r\\nlagged the steady and substantial comeback we have seen in almost all other sectors of our economy. \\r\\n\\r\\nWise monetary and fiscal policies play an important role in tempering recessions, but these tools don\\'t \\r\\ncreate households nor eliminate excess housing units. Fortunately, demographics and our market \\r\\nsystem will restore the needed balance - probably before long. When that day comes, we will again \\r\\nbuild one million or more residential units annually. I believe pundits will be surprised at how far \\r\\nunemployment drops once that happens. They will then reawake to what has been true since 1776: \\r\\nAmerica\\'s best days lie ahead. \\r\\n\\r\\nIntrinsic Business Value \\r\\n\\r\\nCharlie and I measure our performance by the rate of gain in Berkshire\\'s per-share intrinsic business \\r\\nvalue. If our gain over time outstrips the performance of the S&P 500, we have earned our paychecks. If it \\r\\ndoesn\\'t, we are overpaid at any price. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe have no way to pinpoint intrinsic value. But we do have a useful, though considerably understated, \\r\\nproxy for it: per-share book value. This yardstick is meaningless at most companies. At Berkshire, however, \\r\\nbook value very roughly tracks business values. That\\'s because the amount by which Berkshire\\'s intrinsic value \\r\\nexceeds book value does not swing wildly from year to year, though it increases in most years. Over time, the \\r\\ndivergence will likely become ever more substantial in absolute terms, remaining reasonably steady, however, on \\r\\na percentage basis as both the numerator and denominator of the business-value/book-value equation increase. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n5 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWe\\'ve regularly emphasized that our book-value performance is almost certain to outpace the S&P 500 \\r\\nin a bad year for the stock market and just as certainly will fall short in a strong up-year. The test is how we do \\r\\nover time. Last year\\'s annual report included a table laying out results for the 42 five-year periods since we took \\r\\nover at Berkshire in 1965 (i.e., 1965-69, 1966-70, etc.). All showed our book value beating the S&P, and our \\r\\nstring held for 2007-11. It will almost certainly snap, though, if the S&P 500 should put together a five-year \\r\\nwinning streak (which it may well be on its way to doing as I write this). \\r\\n\\r\\nI also included two tables last year that set forth the key quantitative ingredients that will help you \\r\\nestimate our per-share intrinsic value. I won\\'t repeat the full discussion here; you can find it reproduced on \\r\\npages 99-100. To update the tables shown there, our per-share investments in 201 1 increased 4% to $98,366, and \\r\\nour pre-tax earnings from businesses other than insurance and investments increased 18% to $6,990 per share. \\r\\n\\r\\nCharlie and I like to see gains in both areas, but our primary focus is on building operating earnings. Over \\r\\ntime, the businesses we currently own should increase their aggregate earnings, and we hope also to purchase some \\r\\nlarge operations that will give us a further boost. We now have eight subsidiaries that would each be included in the \\r\\nFortune 500 were they stand-alone companies. That leaves only 492 to go. My task is clear, and I\\'m on the prowl. \\r\\n\\r\\nShare Repurchases \\r\\n\\r\\nLast September, we announced that Berkshire would repurchase its shares at a price of up to 110% of book \\r\\nvalue. We were in the market for only a few days - buying $67 million of stock - before the price advanced beyond \\r\\nour limit. Nonetheless, the general importance of share repurchases suggests I should focus for a bit on the subject. \\r\\n\\r\\nCharlie and I favor repurchases when two conditions are met: first, a company has ample funds to take \\r\\ncare of the operational and liquidity needs of its business; second, its stock is selling at a material discount to the \\r\\ncompany\\'s intrinsic business value, conservatively calculated. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe have witnessed many bouts of repurchasing that failed our second test. Sometimes, of course, \\r\\ninfractions - even serious ones - are innocent; many CEOs never stop believing their stock is cheap. In other \\r\\ninstances, a less benign conclusion seems warranted. It doesn\\'t suffice to say that repurchases are being made to \\r\\noffset the dilution from stock issuances or simply because a company has excess cash. Continuing shareholders \\r\\nare hurt unless shares are purchased below intrinsic value. The first law of capital allocation - whether the \\r\\nmoney is slated for acquisitions or share repurchases - is that what is smart at one price is dumb at another. (One \\r\\nCEO who always stresses the price/value factor in repurchase decisions is Jamie Dimon at J.P. Morgan; I \\r\\nrecommend that you read his annual letter.) \\r\\n\\r\\nCharlie and I have mixed emotions when Berkshire shares sell well below intrinsic value. We like \\r\\nmaking money for continuing shareholders, and there is no surer way to do that than by buying an asset - our \\r\\nown stock - that we know to be worth at least x for less than that - for .9x, .8x or even lower. (As one of our \\r\\ndirectors says, it\\'s like shooting fish in a barrel, after the barrel has been drained and the fish have quit flopping.) \\r\\nNevertheless, we don\\'t enjoy cashing out partners at a discount, even though our doing so may give the selling \\r\\nshareholders a slightly higher price than they would receive if our bid was absent. When we are buying, \\r\\ntherefore, we want those exiting partners to be fully informed about the value of the assets they are selling. \\r\\n\\r\\nAt our limit price of 110% of book value, repurchases clearly increase Berkshire\\'s per-share intrinsic \\r\\nvalue. And the more and the cheaper we buy, the greater the gain for continuing shareholders. Therefore, if given \\r\\nthe opportunity, we will likely repurchase stock aggressively at our price limit or lower. You should know, \\r\\nhowever, that we have no interest in supporting the stock and that our bids will fade in particularly weak markets. \\r\\nNor will we buy shares if our cash-equivalent holdings are below $20 billion. At Berkshire, financial strength \\r\\nthat is unquestionable takes precedence over all else. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis discussion of repurchases offers me the chance to address the irrational reaction of many investors \\r\\nto changes in stock prices. When Berkshire buys stock in a company that is repurchasing shares, we hope for two \\r\\nevents: First, we have the normal hope that earnings of the business will increase at a good clip for a long time to \\r\\ncome; and second, we also hope that the stock underperforms in the market for a long time as well. A corollary to \\r\\nthis second point: \"Talking our book\" about a stock we own - were that to be effective - would actually be \\r\\nharmful to Berkshire, not helpful as commentators customarily assume. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n6 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLet\\'s use IBM as an example. As all business observers know, CEOs Lou Gerstner and Sam Palmisano \\r\\ndid a superb job in moving IBM from near-bankruptcy twenty years ago to its prominence today. Their \\r\\noperational accomplishments were truly extraordinary. \\r\\n\\r\\nBut their financial management was equally brilliant, particularly in recent years as the company\\'s \\r\\nfinancial flexibility improved. Indeed, I can think of no major company that has had better financial management, a \\r\\nskill that has materially increased the gains enjoyed by IBM shareholders. The company has used debt wisely, made \\r\\nvalue-adding acquisitions almost exclusively for cash and aggressively repurchased its own stock. \\r\\n\\r\\nToday, IBM has 1.16 billion shares outstanding, of which we own about 63.9 million or 5.5%. \\r\\nNaturally, what happens to the company\\'s earnings over the next five years is of enormous importance to us. \\r\\nBeyond that, the company will likely spend $50 billion or so in those years to repurchase shares. Our quiz for the \\r\\nday: What should a long-term shareholder, such as Berkshire, cheer for during that period? \\r\\n\\r\\nI won\\'t keep you in suspense. We should wish for IBM\\'s stock price to languish throughout the five years. \\r\\n\\r\\nLet\\'s do the math. If IBM\\'s stock price averages, say, $200 during the period, the company will acquire \\r\\n250 million shares for its $50 billion. There would consequently be 910 million shares outstanding, and we \\r\\nwould own about 7% of the company. If the stock conversely sells for an average of $300 during the five-year \\r\\nperiod, IBM will acquire only 167 million shares. That would leave about 990 million shares outstanding after \\r\\nfive years, of which we would own 6.5%. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf IBM were to earn, say, $20 billion in the fifth year, our share of those earnings would be a full $100 \\r\\nmillion greater under the \"disappointing\" scenario of a lower stock price than they would have been at the higher \\r\\nprice. At some later point our shares would be worth perhaps $1 Vi billion more than if the \"high-price\" \\r\\nrepurchase scenario had taken place. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe logic is simple: If you are going to be a net buyer of stocks in the future, either directly with your own \\r\\nmoney or indirectly (through your ownership of a company that is repurchasing shares), you are hurt when stocks \\r\\nrise. You benefit when stocks swoon. Emotions, however, too often complicate the matter: Most people, including \\r\\nthose who will be net buyers in the future, take comfort in seeing stock prices advance. These shareholders resemble \\r\\na commuter who rejoices after the price of gas increases, simply because his tank contains a day\\'s supply. \\r\\n\\r\\nCharlie and I don\\'t expect to win many of you over to our way of thinking - we\\'ve observed enough \\r\\nhuman behavior to know the futility of that - but we do want you to be aware of our personal calculus. And here \\r\\na confession is in order: In my early days I, too, rejoiced when the market rose. Then I read Chapter Eight of Ben \\r\\nGraham\\'s The Intelligent Investor, the chapter dealing with how investors should view fluctuations in stock \\r\\nprices. Immediately the scales fell from my eyes, and low prices became my friend. Picking up that book was one \\r\\nof the luckiest moments in my life. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the end, the success of our IBM investment will be determined primarily by its future earnings. But \\r\\nan important secondary factor will be how many shares the company purchases with the substantial sums it is \\r\\nlikely to devote to this activity. And if repurchases ever reduce the IBM shares outstanding to 63.9 million, I will \\r\\nabandon my famed frugality and give Berkshire employees a paid holiday. \\r\\n\\r\\nNow, let\\'s examine the four major sectors of our operations. Each has vastly different balance sheet \\r\\nand income characteristics from the others. Lumping them together therefore impedes analysis. So we\\'ll present \\r\\nthem as four separate businesses, which is how Charlie and I view them. Because we may be repurchasing \\r\\nBerkshire shares from some of you, we will offer our thoughts in each section as to how intrinsic value compares \\r\\nto carrying value. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n7 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nInsurance \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLet\\'s look first at insurance, Berkshire\\'s core operation and the engine that has propelled our expansion \\r\\nover the years. \\r\\n\\r\\nProperty-casualty (\"P/C\") insurers receive premiums upfront and pay claims later. In extreme cases, \\r\\nsuch as those arising from certain workers\\' compensation accidents, payments can stretch over decades. This \\r\\ncollect-now, pay-later model leaves us holding large sums - money we call \"float\" - that will eventually go to \\r\\nothers. Meanwhile, we get to invest this float for Berkshire\\'s benefit. Though individual policies and claims \\r\\ncome and go, the amount of float we hold remains remarkably stable in relation to premium volume. \\r\\nConsequently, as our business grows, so does our float. And how we have grown, as the following table shows: \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nYear \\r\\n\\r\\nFloat ( in $ mil \\r\\n\\r\\n1970 \\r\\n\\r\\n$ 39 \\r\\n\\r\\n1980 \\r\\n\\r\\n237 \\r\\n\\r\\n1990 \\r\\n\\r\\n1,632 \\r\\n\\r\\n2000 \\r\\n\\r\\n27,871 \\r\\n\\r\\n2010 \\r\\n\\r\\n65,832 \\r\\n\\r\\n2011 \\r\\n\\r\\n70,571 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\'s unlikely that our float will grow much - if at all - from its current level. That\\'s mainly because we \\r\\nalready have an outsized amount relative to our premium volume. Were there to be a decline in float, I will add, \\r\\nit would almost certainly be very gradual and therefore impose no unusual demand for funds on us. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf our premiums exceed the total of our expenses and eventual losses, we register an underwriting profit \\r\\nthat adds to the investment income our float produces. When such a profit occurs, we enjoy the use of free \\r\\nmoney - and, better yet, get paid for holding it. Unfortunately, the wish of all insurers to achieve this happy \\r\\nresult creates intense competition, so vigorous in most years that it causes the P/C industry as a whole to \\r\\noperate at a significant underwriting loss. For example. State Farm, by far the country \\' s largest insurer and a well-managed \\r\\ncompany besides, has incurred an underwriting loss in eight of the last eleven years. There are \\r\\na lot of ways to lose money in insurance, and the industry is resourceful in creating new ones. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs noted in the first section of this report, we have now operated at an underwriting profit for nine \\r\\nconsecutive years, our gain for the period having totaled $17 billion. I believe it likely that we will continue to \\r\\nunderwrite profitably in most - though certainly not all - future years. If we accomplish that, our float will be \\r\\nbetter than cost-free. We will profit just as we would if some party deposited $70.6 billion with us, paid us a fee \\r\\nfor holding its money and then let us invest its funds for our own benefit. \\r\\n\\r\\nSo how does this attractive float affect intrinsic value calculations? Our float is deducted in full as a \\r\\nliability in calculating Berkshire\\'s book value, just as if we had to pay it out tomorrow and were unable to \\r\\nreplenish it. But that\\'s an incorrect way to view float, which should instead be viewed as a revolving fund. If \\r\\nfloat is both costless and long-enduring, the true value of this liability is far lower than the accounting liability. \\r\\n\\r\\nPartially offsetting this overstated liability is $15.5 billion of \"goodwill\" attributable to our insurance \\r\\ncompanies that is included in book value as an asset. In effect, this goodwill represents the price we paid for the \\r\\nfloat-generating capabilities of our insurance operations. The cost of the goodwill, however, has no bearing on its \\r\\ntrue value. If an insurance business produces large and sustained underwriting losses, any goodwill asset \\r\\nattributable to it should be deemed valueless, whatever its original cost. \\r\\n\\r\\nFortunately, that\\'s not the case at Berkshire. Charlie and I believe the true economic value of our \\r\\ninsurance goodwill - what we would pay to purchase float of similar quality - to be far in excess of its historic \\r\\ncarrying value. The value of our float is one reason - a huge reason - why we believe Berkshire\\'s intrinsic \\r\\nbusiness value substantially exceeds book value. \\r\\n\\r\\nLet me emphasize once again that cost-free float is not an outcome to be expected for the P/C industry \\r\\nas a whole: We don\\'t think there is much \"Berkshire-quality\" float existing in the insurance world. In most years, \\r\\nincluding 2011, the industry\\'s premiums have been inadequate to cover claims plus expenses. Consequently, the \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n8 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nindustry\\'s overall return on tangible equity has for many decades fallen far short of the average return realized by \\r\\nAmerican industry, a sorry performance almost certain to continue. Berkshire\\'s outstanding economics exist only \\r\\nbecause we have some terrific managers running some extraordinary insurance operations. Let me tell you about \\r\\nthe major units. \\r\\n\\r\\nFirst by float size is the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group, run by Ajit Jain. Ajit insures risks \\r\\nthat no one else has the desire or the capital to take on. His operation combines capacity, speed, decisiveness and, \\r\\nmost importantly, brains in a manner that is unique in the insurance business. Yet he never exposes Berkshire to \\r\\nrisks that are inappropriate in relation to our resources. Indeed, we are far more conservative in that respect than \\r\\nmost large insurers. For example, if the insurance industry should experience a $250 billion loss from some \\r\\nmega-catastrophe - a loss about triple anything it has ever faced - Berkshire as a whole would likely record a \\r\\nmoderate profit for the year because of its many streams of earnings. Concurrently, all other major insurers and \\r\\nreinsurers would be far in the red, and some would face insolvency. \\r\\n\\r\\nFrom a standing start in 1985, Ajit has created an insurance business with float of $34 billion and \\r\\nsignificant underwriting profits, a feat that no CEO of any other insurer has come close to matching. By these \\r\\naccomplishments, he has added a great many billions of dollars to the value of Berkshire. Charlie would gladly \\r\\ntrade me for a second Ajit. Alas, there is none. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe have another insurance powerhouse in General Re, managed by Tad Montross. \\r\\n\\r\\nAt bottom, a sound insurance operation needs to adhere to four disciplines. It must (1) understand all \\r\\nexposures that might cause a policy to incur losses; (2) conservatively evaluate the likelihood of any exposure \\r\\nactually causing a loss and the probable cost if it does; (3) set a premium that will deliver a profit, on average, \\r\\nafter both prospective loss costs and operating expenses are covered; and (4) be willing to walk away if the \\r\\nappropriate premium can\\'t be obtained. \\r\\n\\r\\nMany insurers pass the first three tests and flunk the fourth. They simply can\\'t turn their back on business \\r\\nthat their competitors are eagerly writing. That old line, \"The other guy is doing it so we must as well,\" spells \\r\\ntrouble in any business, but in none more so than insurance. Indeed, a good underwriter needs an independent \\r\\nmindset akin to that of the senior citizen who received a call from his wife while driving home. \"Albert, be careful,\" \\r\\nshe warned, \"I just heard on the radio that there\\'s a car going the wrong way down the Interstate.\" \"Mabel, they \\r\\ndon\\'t know the half of it,\" replied Albert, \"It\\'s not just one car, there are hundreds of them.\" \\r\\n\\r\\nTad has observed all four of the insurance commandments, and it shows in his results. General Re\\'s \\r\\nhuge float has been better than cost-free under his leadership, and we expect that, on average, it will continue to \\r\\nbe. In the first few years after we acquired it, General Re was a major headache. Now it\\'s a treasure. \\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, there is GEICO, the insurer on which I cut my teeth 61 years ago. GEICO is run by Tony \\r\\nNicely, who joined the company at 18 and completed 50 years of service in 2011. \\r\\n\\r\\nGEICO\\' s much-envied record comes from Tony\\'s brilliant execution of a superb and almost- \\r\\nimpossible-to-replicate business model. During Tony\\'s 18-year tenure as CEO, our market share has grown from 2.0% \\r\\nto 9.3%. If it had instead remained static - as it had for more than a decade before he took over - our premium volume \\r\\nwould now be $3.3 billion rather than the $15.4 billion we attained in 2011. The extra value created by Tony and his \\r\\nassociates is a major element in Berkshire\\'s excess of intrinsic value over book value. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere is still more than 90% of the auto-insurance market left for GEICO to rake in. Don\\'t bet against \\r\\nTony acquiring chunks of it year after year in the future. Our low costs permit low prices, and every day more \\r\\nAmericans discover that the Gecko is doing them a favor when he urges them to visit GEICO.com for a quote. \\r\\n(Our lizard has another endearing quality: Unlike human spokesmen or spokeswomen who expensively represent \\r\\nother insurance companies, our little fellow has no agent.) \\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to our three major insurance operations, we own a group of smaller companies, most of \\r\\nthem plying their trade in odd corners of the insurance world. In aggregate, their results have consistently been \\r\\nprofitable and the float they provide us is substantial. Charlie and I treasure these companies and their managers. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n9 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAt yearend, we acquired Princeton Insurance, a New Jersey writer of medical malpractice policies. This \\r\\nbolt-on transaction expands the managerial domain of Tim Kenesey, the star CEO of Medical Protective, our \\r\\nIndiana-based med-mal insurer. Princeton brings with it more than $600 million of float, an amount that is \\r\\nincluded in the following table. \\r\\n\\r\\nHere is the record of all four segments of our property-casualty and life insurance businesses: \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nUnderwriting Profit Yearend Float \\r\\n(in millions) \\r\\n\\r\\nInsurance Operations 2011 2010 2011 2010 \\r\\n\\r\\nBH Reinsurance $(714) $ 176 $33,728 $30,370 \\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral Re 144 452 19,714 20,049 \\r\\n\\r\\nGEICO 576 1,117 11,169 10,272 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther Primary 242 268 5,960 5,141 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n$ 248 $2,013 $70,571 $65,832 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong large insurance operations, Berkshire\\'s impresses me as the best in the world. \\r\\n\\r\\nRegulated, Capital-intensive Businesses \\r\\n\\r\\nWe have two very large businesses, BNSF and MidAmerican Energy, that have important common \\r\\ncharacteristics distinguishing them from our many other businesses. Consequently, we assign them their own sector \\r\\nin this letter and also split out their combined financial statistics in our GAAP balance sheet and income statement. \\r\\n\\r\\nA key characteristic of both companies is the huge investment they have in very long-lived, regulated \\r\\nassets, with these partially funded by large amounts of long-term debt that is not guaranteed by Berkshire. Our \\r\\ncredit is not needed: Both businesses have earning power that even under terrible business conditions amply \\r\\ncovers their interest requirements. In a less than robust economy during 2011, for example, BNSF\\'s interest \\r\\ncoverage was 9.5x. At MidAmerican, meanwhile, two key factors ensure its ability to service debt under all \\r\\ncircumstances: The stability of earnings that is inherent in our exclusively offering an essential service and a \\r\\ndiversity of earnings streams, which shield it from the actions of any single regulatory body. \\r\\n\\r\\nMeasured by ton-miles, rail moves 42% of America\\'s inter-city freight, and BNSF moves more than \\r\\nany other railroad - about 37% of the industry total. A little math will tell you that about 15% of all inter-city \\r\\nton-miles of freight in the U.S. is transported by BNSF. It is no exaggeration to characterize railroads as the \\r\\ncirculatory system of our economy. Your railroad is the largest artery. \\r\\n\\r\\nAll of this places a huge responsibility on us. We must, without fail, maintain and improve our 23,000 \\r\\nmiles of track along with 13,000 bridges, 80 tunnels, 6,900 locomotives and 78,600 freight cars. This job requires \\r\\nus to have ample financial resources under all economic scenarios and to have the human talent that can instantly \\r\\nand effectively deal with the vicissitudes of nature, such as the widespread flooding BNSF labored under last \\r\\nsummer. \\r\\n\\r\\nTo fulfill its societal obligation, BNSF regularly invests far more than its depreciation charge, with the \\r\\nexcess amounting to $1.8 billion in 2011. The three other major U.S. railroads are making similar outlays. \\r\\nThough many people decry our country\\'s inadequate infrastructure spending, that criticism cannot be levied \\r\\nagainst the railroad industry. It is pouring money - funds from the private sector - into the investment projects \\r\\nneeded to provide better and more extensive service in the future. If railroads were not making these huge \\r\\nexpenditures, our country\\'s publicly-financed highway system would face even greater congestion and \\r\\nmaintenance problems than exist today. \\r\\n\\r\\nMassive investments of the sort that BNSF is making would be foolish if it could not earn appropriate \\r\\nreturns on the incremental sums it commits. But I am confident it will do so because of the value it delivers. \\r\\nMany years ago Ben Franklin counseled, \"Keep thy shop, and thy shop will keep thee.\" Translating this to our \\r\\nregulated businesses, he might today say, \"Take care of your customer, and the regulator - your customer\\'s \\r\\nrepresentative - will take care of you.\" Good behavior by each party begets good behavior in return. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n10 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAt MidAmerican, we participate in a similar \"social compact.\" We are expected to put up ever-increasing \\r\\nsums to satisfy the future needs of our customers. If we meanwhile operate reliably and efficiently, \\r\\nwe know that we will obtain a fair return on these investments. \\r\\n\\r\\nMidAmerican, 89.8% owned by Berkshire, supplies 2.5 million customers in the U.S. with electricity, \\r\\noperating as the largest supplier in Iowa, Utah and Wyoming and as an important provider in six other states as \\r\\nwell. Our pipelines transport 8% of the country\\'s natural gas. Obviously, many millions of Americans depend on \\r\\nus every day. They haven\\'t been disappointed. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen MidAmerican purchased Northern Natural Gas pipeline in 2002, that company\\'s performance as \\r\\na pipeline was rated dead last, 43 out of 43, by the leading authority in the field. In the most recent report, \\r\\nNorthern Natural was ranked second. The top spot was held by our other pipeline, Kern River. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn its electric business, MidAmerican has a comparable record. In the most recent survey of customer \\r\\nsatisfaction, MidAmerican\\' s U.S. utilities ranked second among 60 utility groups surveyed. The story was far \\r\\ndifferent not many years back when MidAmerican acquired these properties. \\r\\n\\r\\nMidAmerican will have 3,316 megawatts of wind generation in operation by the end of 2012, far more \\r\\nthan any other regulated electric utility in the country. The total amount that we have invested or committed to \\r\\nwind is a staggering $6 billion. We can make this sort of investment because MidAmerican retains all of its \\r\\nearnings, unlike other utilities that generally pay out most of what they earn. In addition, late last year we took on \\r\\ntwo solar projects - one 100%-owned in California and the other 49%-owned in Arizona - that will cost about $3 \\r\\nbillion to construct. Many more wind and solar projects will almost certainly follow. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs you can tell by now, I am proud of what has been accomplished for our society by Matt Rose at \\r\\nBNSF and by Greg Abel at MidAmerican. I am also both proud and grateful for what they have accomplished for \\r\\nBerkshire shareholders.

Some of the businesses \\r\\nenjoy terrific economics, measured by earnings on unleveraged net tangible assets that run from 25% after-tax to \\r\\nmore than 100%. Others produce good returns in the area of 12-20%. A few, however, have very poor returns, a \\r\\nresult of some serious mistakes I made in my job of capital allocation. These errors came about because I misjudged \\r\\neither the competitive strength of the business being purchased or the future economics of the industry in which it \\r\\noperated. I try to look out ten or twenty years when making an acquisition, but sometimes my eyesight has been \\r\\npoor. Charlie\\'s has been better; he voted no more than \"present\" on several of my errant purchases. \\r\\n\\r\\nBerkshire\\'s newer shareholders may be puzzled over our decision to hold on to my mistakes. After all, \\r\\ntheir earnings can never be consequential to Berkshire\\'s valuation, and problem companies require more \\r\\nmanagerial time than winners. Any management consultant or Wall Street advisor would look at our laggards and \\r\\nsay \"dump them.\" \\r\\n\\r\\nThat won\\'t happen. For 29 years, we have regularly laid out Berkshire\\'s economic principles in these \\r\\nreports (pages 93-98) and Number 1 1 describes our general reluctance to sell poor performers (which, in most \\r\\ncases, lag because of industry factors rather than managerial shortcomings). Our approach is far from Darwinian, \\r\\nand many of you may disapprove of it. I can understand your position. However, we have made - and continue to \\r\\nmake - a commitment to the sellers of businesses we buy that we will retain those businesses through thick and \\r\\nthin. So far, the dollar cost of that commitment has not been substantial and may well be offset by the goodwill it \\r\\nbuilds among prospective sellers looking for the right permanent home for their treasured business and loyal \\r\\nassociates. These owners know that what they get with us can\\'t be delivered by others and that our commitments \\r\\nwill be good for many decades to come. \\r\\n\\r\\n12 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease understand, however, that Charlie and I are neither masochists nor Polly annas. If either of the \\r\\nfailings we set forth in Rule 1 1 is present - if the business will likely be a cash drain over the longer term, or if labor \\r\\nstrife is endemic - we will take prompt and decisive action. Such a situation has happened only a couple of times in \\r\\nour 47 -year history, and none of the businesses we now own is in straits requiring us to consider disposing of it. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe steady and substantial comeback in the U.S. economy since mid-2009 is clear from the earnings \\r\\nshown at the front of this section. This compilation includes 54 of our companies. But one of these, Marmon, is \\r\\nitself the owner of 140 operations in eleven distinct business sectors. In short, when you look at Berkshire, you \\r\\nare looking across corporate America. So let\\'s dig a little deeper to gain a greater insight into what has happened \\r\\nin the last few years. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe four housing-related companies in this section (a group that excludes Clayton, which is carried \\r\\nunder Finance and Financial Products) had aggregate pre-tax earnings of $227 million in 2009, $362 million in \\r\\n2010 and $359 million in 201 1. If you subtract these earnings from those in the combined statement, you will see \\r\\nthat our multiple and diverse non-housing operations earned $1,831 million in 2009, $3,912 million in 2010 and \\r\\n$4,678 million in 201 1. About $291 million of the 201 1 earnings came from the Lubrizol acquisition. The profile \\r\\nof the remaining 2011 earnings - $4,387 million - illustrates the comeback of much of America from the \\r\\ndevastation wrought by the 2008 financial panic. Though housing-related businesses remain in the emergency \\r\\nroom, most other businesses have left the hospital with their health fully restored. \\r\\n\\r\\nAlmost all of our managers delivered outstanding performances last year, among them those managers \\r\\nwho run housing-related businesses and were therefore fighting hurricane-force headwinds. Here are a few examples: \\r\\n\\r\\n• Vic Mancinelli again set a record at CTB, our agricultural equipment operation. We purchased CTB in \\r\\n2002 for $139 million. It has subsequently distributed $180 million to Berkshire, last year earned $124 \\r\\nmillion pre-tax and has $109 million in cash. Vic has made a number of bolt-on acquisitions over the \\r\\nyears, including a meaningful one he signed up after yearend. \\r\\n\\r\\n• TTI, our electric components distributor, increased its sales to a record $2.1 billion, up 12.4% from \\r\\n\\r\\n2010. Earnings also hit a record, up 127% from 2007, the year in which we purchased the business. In \\r\\n\\r\\n2011, TTI performed far better than the large publicly-traded companies in its field. That\\'s no surprise: \\r\\nPaul Andrews and his associates have been besting them for years. Charlie and I are delighted that Paul \\r\\nnegotiated a large bolt-on acquisition early in 2012. We hope more follow. \\r\\n\\r\\n• Iscar, our 80%-owned cutting-tools operation, continues to amaze us. Its sales growth and overall \\r\\nperformance are unique in its industry. Iscar\\' s managers - Eitan Wertheimer, Jacob Harpaz and Danny \\r\\nGoldman - are brilliant strategists and operators. When the economic world was cratering in November \\r\\n2008, they stepped up to buy Tungaloy, a leading Japanese cutting-tool manufacturer. Tungaloy \\r\\nsuffered significant damage when the tsunami hit north of Tokyo last spring. But you wouldn\\'t know \\r\\nthat now: Tungaloy went on to set a sales record in 2011. I visited the Iwaki plant in November and \\r\\nwas inspired by the dedication and enthusiasm of Tungaloy\\' s management, as well as its staff. They are \\r\\na wonderful group and deserve your admiration and thanks. \\r\\n\\r\\n• McLane, our huge distribution company that is run by Grady Rosier, added important new customers in \\r\\n2011 and set a pre-tax earnings record of $370 million. Since its purchase in 2003 for $1.5 billion, the \\r\\ncompany has had pre-tax earnings of $2.4 billion and also increased its LIFO reserve by $230 million \\r\\nbecause the prices of the retail products it distributes (candy, gum, cigarettes, etc.) have risen. Grady \\r\\nruns a logistical machine second to none. You can look for bolt-ons at McLane, particularly in our new \\r\\nwine-and-spirits distribution business. \\r\\n\\r\\n13 \\r\\n\\r\\nJordan Hansell took over at NetJets in April and delivered 201 1 pre-tax earnings of $227 million. That \\r\\nis a particularly impressive performance because the sale of new planes was slow during most of the \\r\\nyear. In December, however, there was an uptick that was more than seasonally normal. How \\r\\npermanent it will be is uncertain. \\r\\n\\r\\nA few years ago NetJets was my number one worry: Its costs were far out of line with revenues, and \\r\\ncash was hemorrhaging. Without Berkshire\\'s support, NetJets would have gone broke. These problems \\r\\nare behind us, and Jordan is now delivering steady profits from a well-controlled and smoothly-running \\r\\noperation. NetJets is proceeding on a plan to enter China with some first-class partners, a move that \\r\\nwill widen our business \"moat.\" No other fractional-ownership operator has remotely the size and \\r\\nbreadth of the NetJets operation, and none ever will. Ne Jets\\' unrelenting focus on safety and service \\r\\nhas paid off in the marketplace. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\'s a joy to watch Marmon\\'s progress under Frank Ptak\\'s leadership. In addition to achieving internal \\r\\ngrowth, Frank regularly makes bolt-on acquisitions that, in aggregate, will materially increase Marmon\\'s \\r\\nearning power. (He did three, costing about $270 million, in the last few months.) Joint ventures around \\r\\nthe world are another opportunity for Marmon. At midyear Marmon partnered with the Kundalia family \\r\\nin an Indian crane operation that is already delivering substantial profits. This is Marmon\\'s second \\r\\nventure with the family, following a successful wire and cable partnership instituted a few years ago. \\r\\n\\r\\nOf the eleven major sectors in which Marmon operates, ten delivered gains in earnings last year. You \\r\\ncan be confident of higher earnings from Marmon in the years ahead. \\r\\n\\r\\n\"Buy commodities, sell brands\" has long been a formula for business success. It has produced \\r\\nenormous and sustained profits for Coca-Cola since 1886 and Wrigley since 1891. On a smaller scale, \\r\\nwe have enjoyed good fortune with this approach at See\\'s Candy since we purchased it 40 years ago. \\r\\n\\r\\nLast year See\\'s had record pre-tax earnings of $83 million, bringing its total since we bought it to $1.65 \\r\\nbillion. Contrast that figure with our purchase price of $25 million and our yearend carrying-value (net \\r\\nof cash) of less than zero. (Yes, you read that right; capital employed at See\\'s fluctuates seasonally, \\r\\nhitting a low after Christmas.) Credit Brad Kinstler for taking the company to new heights since he \\r\\nbecame CEO in 2006. \\r\\n\\r\\nNebraska Furniture Mart (80% owned) set an earnings record in 201 1, netting more than ten times what \\r\\nit did in 1983, when we acquired our stake. \\r\\n\\r\\nBut that\\'s not the big news. More important was NFM\\'s acquisition of a 433-acre tract north of Dallas \\r\\non which we will build what is almost certain to be the highest-volume home-furnishings store in the \\r\\ncountry. Currently, that title is shared by our two stores in Omaha and Kansas City, each of which had \\r\\nrecord-setting sales ol more than $400 million in 2011. It will be several years before the Texas store is \\r\\ncompleted, but I look forward to cutting the ribbon at the opening. (At Berkshire, the managers do the \\r\\nwork; I take the bows.) \\r\\n\\r\\nOur new store, which will offer an unequalled variety of merchandise sold at prices that can\\'t be \\r\\nmatched, will bring huge crowds from near and far. This drawing power and our extensive holdings of \\r\\nland at the site should enable us to attract a number of other major stores. (If any high-volume retailers \\r\\nare reading this, contact me.) \\r\\n\\r\\nOur experience with NFM and the Blumkin family that runs it has been a real joy. The business was \\r\\nbuilt by Rose Blumkin (known to all as \"Mrs. B\"), who started the company in 1937 with $500 and a \\r\\ndream. She sold me our interest when she was 89 and worked until she was 103. (After retiring, she \\r\\ndied the next year, a sequence I point out to any other Berkshire manager who even thinks of retiring.) \\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. B\\'s son, Louie, now 92, helped his mother build the business after he returned from World War II \\r\\nand, along with his wife, Fran, has been my friend for 55 years. In turn, Louie\\'s sons, Ron and Irv, have \\r\\ntaken the company to new heights, first opening the Kansas City store and now gearing up for Texas. \\r\\n\\r\\n14 \\r\\n\\r\\nThe \"boys\" and I have had many great times together, and I count them among my best friends. The \\r\\nBlumkins are a remarkable family. Never inclined to let an extraordinary gene pool go to waste, I am \\r\\nrejoicing these days because several members of the fourth Blumkin generation have joined NFM. \\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, the intrinsic value of the businesses in this Berkshire sector significantly exceeds their book \\r\\nvalue. For many of the smaller companies, however, this is not true. I have made more than my share of mistakes \\r\\nbuying small companies. Charlie long ago told me, \"If something\\'s not worth doing at all, it\\'s not worth \\r\\ndoing well,\" and I should have listened harder. In any event, our large purchases have generally worked \\r\\nwell - extraordinarily well in a few cases - and overall this sector is a winner for us. \\r\\n\\r\\nCertain shareholders have told me they hunger for more discussions of accounting arcana. So here\\'s a \\r\\nbit of GAAP-mandated nonsense I hope both of them enjoy. \\r\\n\\r\\nCommon sense would tell you that our varied subsidiaries should be carried on our books at their cost \\r\\nplus the earnings they have retained since our purchase (unless their economic value has materially decreased, in \\r\\nwhich case an appropriate write-down must be taken). And that\\'s essentially the reality at Berkshire - except for \\r\\nthe weird situation at Marmon. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe purchased 64% of the company in 2008 and put this interest on our books at our cost, $4.8 billion. \\r\\nSo far, so good. Then, in early 2011, pursuant to our original contract with the Pritzker family, we purchased an \\r\\nadditional 16%, paying $1.5 billion as called for by a formula that reflected Marmon\\'s increased value. In this \\r\\ninstance, however, we were required to immediately write off $614 million of the purchase price retroactive to \\r\\nthe end of 2010. (Don\\'t ask!) Obviously, this write-off had no connection to economic reality. The excess of \\r\\nMarmon\\'s intrinsic value over its carrying value is widened by this meaningless write-down. \\r\\n\\r\\nFinance and Financial Products \\r\\n\\r\\nThis sector, our smallest, includes two rental companies, XTRA (trailers) and CORT (furniture), and \\r\\nClayton Homes, the country\\'s leading producer and financer of manufactured homes. Aside from these 100%-owned \\r\\nsubsidiaries, we also include in this category a collection of financial assets and our 50% interest in Berkadia \\r\\nCommercial Mortgage. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\'s instructive to look at what transpired at our three operating businesses after the economy fell off a \\r\\ncliff in late 2008, because their experiences illuminate the fractured recovery that later came along. \\r\\n\\r\\nResults at our two leasing companies mirrored the \"non-housing\" economy. Their combined pre-tax \\r\\nearnings were $13 million in 2009, $53 million in 2010 and $155 million in 2011, an improvement reflecting the \\r\\nsteady recovery we have seen in almost all of our non-housing businesses. In contrast, Clayton\\'s world of \\r\\nmanufactured housing (just like site-built housing) has endured a veritable depression, experiencing no recovery \\r\\nto date. Manufactured housing sales in the nation were 49,789 homes in 2009, 50,046 in 2010 and 51,606 in \\r\\n2011. (When housing was booming in 2005, they were 146,744.) \\r\\n\\r\\nDespite these difficult times, Clayton has continued to operate profitably, largely because its mortgage \\r\\nportfolio has performed well under trying circumstances. Because we are the largest lender in the manufactured \\r\\nhomes sector and are also normally lending to lower-and-middle-income families, you might expect us to suffer \\r\\nheavy losses during a housing meltdown. But by sticking to old-fashioned loan policies - meaningful down \\r\\npayments and monthly payments with a sensible relationship to regular income - Clayton has kept losses to \\r\\nacceptable levels. It has done so even though many of our borrowers have had negative equity for some time. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs is well-known, the U.S. went off the rails in its home-ownership and mortgage-lending policies, \\r\\nand for these mistakes our economy is now paying a huge price. All of us participated in the destructive \\r\\nbehavior - government, lenders, borrowers, the media, rating agencies, you name it. At the core of the folly was \\r\\nthe almost universal belief that the value of houses was certain to increase over time and that any dips \\r\\nwould be inconsequential. The acceptance of this premise justified almost any price and practice in housing \\r\\ntransactions. Homeowners everywhere felt richer and rushed to \"monetize\" the increased value of their homes by \\r\\nrefinancings. These massive cash infusions fueled a consumption binge throughout our economy. It all seemed \\r\\ngreat fun while it lasted. (A largely unnoted fact: Large numbers of people who have \"lost\" their house through \\r\\nforeclosure have actually realized a profit because they carried out refinancings earlier that gave them cash in \\r\\nexcess of their cost. In these cases, the evicted homeowner was the winner, and the victim was the lender.) \\r\\n\\r\\n15 \\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2007, the bubble burst, just as all bubbles must. We are now in the fourth year of a cure that, though \\r\\nlong and painful, is sure to succeed. Today, household formations are consistently exceeding housing starts. \\r\\n\\r\\nClayton\\'s earnings should improve materially when the nation\\'s excess housing inventory is worked \\r\\noff. As I see things today, however, I believe the intrinsic value of the three businesses in this sector does not \\r\\ndiffer materially from their book value. \\r\\n\\r\\nInvestments \\r\\n\\r\\nBelow we show our common stock investments that at yearend had a market value of more than $1 billion. \\r\\n\\r\\n12/31/11 \\r\\n\\r\\nPercentage of \\r\\n\\r\\nShares Company Company Cost* Market \\r\\n\\r\\nOwned \\r\\n\\r\\n(in millions) \\r\\n\\r\\n151,610,700 \\r\\nAmerican Express Company \\r\\n13.0 \\r\\n$ 1,287 \\r\\n$ 7,151 \\r\\n200,000,000 \\r\\nThe Coca-Cola Company \\r\\n8.8 \\r\\n1,299 \\r\\n13,994 \\r\\n29,100,937 \\r\\nConocoPhillips \\r\\n2.3 \\r\\n2,027 \\r\\n2,121 \\r\\n63,905,931 \\r\\nInternational Business Machines Corp \\r\\n5.5 \\r\\n10,856 \\r\\n11,751 \\r\\n31,416,127 \\r\\nJohnson & Johnson \\r\\n1.2 \\r\\n1,880 \\r\\n2,060 \\r\\n79,034,713 \\r\\nKraft Foods Inc \\r\\n4.5 \\r\\n2,589 \\r\\n2,953 \\r\\n20,060,390 \\r\\nMunich Re > \\r\\n11.3 \\r\\n2,990 \\r\\n2,464 \\r\\n3,947,555 \\r\\nPOSCO \\r\\n5.1 \\r\\n768 \\r\\n1,301 \\r\\n72,391,036 \\r\\nThe Procter & Gamble Company \\r\\n2.6 \\r\\n464 \\r\\n4,829 \\r\\n25,848,838 \\r\\nSanofi \\r\\n1.9 \\r\\n2,055 \\r\\n1,900 \\r\\n291,577,428 \\r\\nTpsrn pip A \\r\\n3.6 \\r\\n1,719 \\r\\n1,827 \\r\\n78,060,769 \\r\\nU.S. Bancorp \\r\\n4.1 \\r\\n2,401 \\r\\n2,112 \\r\\n39,037,142 \\r\\nWal-Mart Stores, Inc ^^^-^^ \\r\\n1.1 \\r\\n1,893 \\r\\n2,333 \\r\\n400,015,828 \\r\\nWells Fargo & Company \\r\\n7.6 \\r\\n9,086 \\r\\n11,024 \\r\\nOthers \\r\\n6,895 \\r\\n9,171 \\r\\nTotal Common Stocks Carried at Market .... \\r\\n$48,209 \\r\\n$76,991 \\r\\n\\r\\n*This is our actual purchase price and also our tax basis; GAAP \"cost\" differs in a few cases because of \\r\\nwrite-ups or write-downs that have been required. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe made few changes in our investment holdings during 2011. But three moves were important: our \\r\\npurchases of IBM and Bank of America and the $1 billion addition we made to our Wells Fargo position. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe banking industry is back on its feet, and Wells Fargo is prospering. Its earnings are strong, its \\r\\nassets solid and its capital at record levels. At Bank of America, some huge mistakes were made by prior \\r\\nmanagement. Brian Moynihan has made excellent progress in cleaning these up, though the completion of that \\r\\nprocess will take a number of years. Concurrently, he is nurturing a huge and attractive underlying business that \\r\\nwill endure long after today\\'s problems are forgotten. Our warrants to buy 700 million Bank of America shares \\r\\nwill likely be of great value before they expire. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs was the case with Coca-Cola in 1988 and the railroads in 2006, 1 was late to the IBM party. I have \\r\\nbeen reading the company\\'s annual report for more than 50 years, but it wasn\\'t until a Saturday in March last \\r\\nyear that my thinking crystallized. As Thoreau said, \"It\\'s not what you look at that matters, it\\'s what you see.\" \\r\\n\\r\\nTodd Combs built a $1.75 billion portfolio (at cost) last year, and Ted Weschler will soon create one of \\r\\nsimilar size. Each of them receives 80% of his performance compensation from his own results and 20% from his \\r\\npartner\\'s. When our quarterly filings report relatively small holdings, these are not likely to be buys I made \\r\\n(though the media often overlook that point) but rather holdings denoting purchases by Todd or Ted. \\r\\n\\r\\n16 \\r\\n\\r\\nOne additional point about these two new arrivals. Both Ted and Todd will be helpful to the next CEO \\r\\nof Berkshire in making acquisitions. They have excellent \"business minds\" that grasp the economic forces likely \\r\\nto determine the future of a wide variety of businesses. They are aided in their thinking by an understanding of \\r\\nwhat is predictable and what is unknowable. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere is little new to report on our derivatives positions, which we have described in detail in past reports. \\r\\n(Annual reports since 1977 are available at www.berkshirehathaway.com.) One important industry change, \\r\\nhowever, must be noted: Though our existing contracts have very minor collateral requirements, the rules have \\r\\nchanged for new positions. Consequently, we will not be initiating any major derivatives positions. We shun \\r\\ncontracts of any type that could require the instant posting of collateral. The possibility of some sudden and huge \\r\\nposting requirement - arising from an out-of-the-blue event such as a worldwide financial panic or massive terrorist \\r\\nattack - is inconsistent with our primary objectives of redundant liquidity and unquestioned financial strength. \\r\\n\\r\\nOur insurance-like derivatives contracts, whereby we pay if various issues included in high-yield bond \\r\\nindices default, are coming to a close. The contracts that most exposed us to losses have already expired, and the \\r\\nremainder will terminate soon. In 2011, we paid out $86 million on two losses, bringing our total payments to \\r\\n$2.6 billion. We are almost certain to realize a final \"underwriting profit\" on this portfolio because the premiums \\r\\nwe received were $3.4 billion, and our future losses are apt to be minor. In addition, we will have averaged about \\r\\n$2 billion of float over the five-year life of these contracts. This successful result during a time of great credit \\r\\nstress underscores the importance of obtaining a premium that is commensurate with the risk. \\r\\n\\r\\nCharlie and I continue to believe that our equity-put positions will produce a significant profit, considering \\r\\nboth the $4.2 billion of float we will have held for more than fifteen years and the $222 million profit we\\'ve already \\r\\nrealized on contracts that we repurchased. At yearend, Berkshire\\'s book value reflected a liability of $8.5 billion for \\r\\nthe remaining contracts; if they had all come due at that time our payment would have been $6.2 billion. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Basic Choices for Investors and the One We Strongly Prefer \\r\\n\\r\\nInvesting is often described as the process of laying out money now in the expectation of receiving \\r\\nmore money in the future. At Berkshire we take a more demanding approach, defining investing as the transfer to \\r\\nothers of purchasing power now with the reasoned expectation of receiving more purchasing power - after taxes \\r\\nhave been paid on nominal gains - in the future. More succinctly, investing is forgoing consumption now in \\r\\norder to have the ability to consume more at a later date. \\r\\n\\r\\nFrom our definition there flows an important corollary: The riskiness of an investment is not measured \\r\\nby beta (a Wall Street term encompassing volatility and often used in measuring risk) but rather by the \\r\\nprobability - the reasoned probability - of that investment causing its owner a loss of purchasing-power over his \\r\\ncontemplated holding period. Assets can fluctuate greatly in price and not be risky as long as they are reasonably \\r\\ncertain to deliver increased purchasing power over their holding period. And as we will see, a non-fluctuating \\r\\nasset can be laden with risk. \\r\\n\\r\\nInvestment possibilities are both many and varied. There are three major categories, however, and it\\'s \\r\\nimportant to understand the characteristics of each. So let\\'s survey the field. \\r\\n\\r\\n• Investments that are denominated in a given currency include money-market funds, bonds, mortgages, \\r\\nbank deposits, and other instruments. Most of these currency-based investments are thought of as \"safe.\" \\r\\nIn truth they are among the most dangerous of assets. Their beta may be zero, but their risk is huge. \\r\\n\\r\\nOver the past century these instruments have destroyed the purchasing power of investors in many \\r\\ncountries, even as the holders continued to receive timely payments of interest and principal. This ugly \\r\\nresult, moreover, will forever recur. Governments determine the ultimate value of money, and systemic \\r\\nforces will sometimes cause them to gravitate to policies that produce inflation. From time to time such \\r\\npolicies spin out of control. \\r\\n\\r\\nEven in the U.S., where the wish for a stable currency is strong, the dollar has fallen a staggering 86% \\r\\nin value since 1965, when I took over management of Berkshire. It takes no less than $7 today to buy \\r\\nwhat $1 did at that time. Consequently, a tax-free institution would have needed 4.3% interest annually \\r\\nfrom bond investments over that period to simply maintain its purchasing power. Its managers would \\r\\nhave been kidding themselves if they thought of any portion of that interest as \"income.\" \\r\\n\\r\\n17 \\r\\n\\r\\nFor tax-paying investors like you and me, the picture has been far worse. During the same 47-year \\r\\nperiod, continuous rolling of U.S. Treasury bills produced 5.7% annually. That sounds satisfactory. But \\r\\nif an individual investor paid personal income taxes at a rate averaging 25%, this 5.7% return would \\r\\nhave yielded nothing in the way of real income. This investor\\'s visible income tax would have stripped \\r\\nhim of 1.4 points of the stated yield, and the invisible inflation tax would have devoured the remaining \\r\\n4.3 points. It\\'s noteworthy that the implicit inflation \"tax\" was more than triple the explicit income tax \\r\\nthat our investor probably thought of as his main burden. \"In God We Trust\" may be imprinted on our \\r\\ncurrency, but the hand that activates our government\\'s printing press has been all too human. \\r\\n\\r\\nHigh interest rates, of course, can compensate purchasers for the inflation risk they face with currency-based \\r\\ninvestments - and indeed, rates in the early 1980s did that job nicely. Current rates, however, do not come \\r\\nclose to offsetting the purchasing-power risk that investors assume. Right now bonds should come with a \\r\\nwarning label. \\r\\n\\r\\nUnder today\\'s conditions, therefore, I do not like currency-based investments. Even so, Berkshire holds \\r\\nsignificant amounts of them, primarily of the short-term variety. At Berkshire the need for ample \\r\\nliquidity occupies center stage and will never be slighted, however inadequate rates may be. \\r\\nAccommodating this need, we primarily hold U.S. Treasury bills, the only investment that can be \\r\\ncounted on for liquidity under the most chaotic of economic conditions. Our working level for liquidity \\r\\nis $20 billion; $10 billion is our absolute minimum. \\r\\n\\r\\nBeyond the requirements that liquidity and regulators impose on us, we will purchase currency-related \\r\\nsecurities only if they offer the possibility of unusual gain - either because a particular credit is \\r\\nmispriced, as can occur in periodic junk-bond debacles, or because rates rise to a level that offers the \\r\\npossibility of realizing substantial capital gains on high-grade bonds when rates fall. Though we\\'ve \\r\\nexploited both opportunities in the past - and may do so again - we are now 1 80 degrees removed from \\r\\nsuch prospects. Today, a wry comment that Wall Streeter Shelby Cullom Davis made long ago seems \\r\\napt: \"Bonds promoted as offering risk-free returns are now priced to deliver return-free risk.\" \\r\\n\\r\\nThe second major category of investments involves assets that will never produce anything, but that are \\r\\npurchased in the buyer\\'s hope that someone else - who also knows that the assets will be forever \\r\\nunproductive - will pay more for them in the future. Tulips, of all things, briefly became a favorite of \\r\\nsuch buyers in the 17 th century. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis type of investment requires an expanding pool of buyers, who, in turn, are enticed because they \\r\\nbelieve the buying pool will expand still further. Owners are not inspired by what the asset itself can \\r\\nproduce - it will remain lifeless forever - but rather by the belief that others will desire it even more \\r\\navidly in the future. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe major asset in this category is gold, currently a huge favorite of investors who fear almost all other \\r\\nassets, especially paper money (of whose value, as noted, they are right to be fearful). Gold, however, \\r\\nhas two significant shortcomings, being neither of much use nor procreative. True, gold has some \\r\\nindustrial and decorative utility, but the demand for these purposes is both limited and incapable of \\r\\nsoaking up new production. Meanwhile, if you own one ounce of gold for an eternity, you will still \\r\\nown one ounce at its end. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhat motivates most gold purchasers is their belief that the ranks of the fearful will grow. During the \\r\\npast decade that belief has proved correct. Beyond that, the rising price has on its own generated \\r\\nadditional buying enthusiasm, attracting purchasers who see the rise as validating an investment thesis. \\r\\nAs \"bandwagon\" investors join any party, they create their own truth - for a while. \\r\\n\\r\\nOver the past 15 years, both Internet stocks and houses have demonstrated the extraordinary excesses \\r\\nthat can be created by combining an initially sensible thesis with well-publicized rising prices. In these \\r\\nbubbles, an army of originally skeptical investors succumbed to the \"proof delivered by the market, \\r\\nand the pool of buyers - for a time - expanded sufficiently to keep the bandwagon rolling. But bubbles \\r\\nblown large enough inevitably pop. And then the old proverb is confirmed once again: \"What the wise \\r\\nman does in the beginning, the fool does in the end.\" \\r\\n\\r\\n18 \\r\\n\\r\\nToday the world\\'s gold stock is about 170,000 metric tons. If all of this gold were melded together, it \\r\\nwould form a cube of about 68 feet per side. (Picture it fitting comfortably within a baseball infield.) At \\r\\n$1,750 per ounce - gold\\'s price as I write this - its value would be $9.6 trillion. Call this cube pile A. \\r\\n\\r\\nLet\\'s now create a pile B costing an equal amount. For that, we could buy all U.S. cropland (400 \\r\\nmillion acres with output of about $200 billion annually), plus 16 Exxon Mobils (the world\\'s most \\r\\nprofitable company, one earning more than $40 billion annually). After these purchases, we would \\r\\nhave about $1 trillion left over for walking-around money (no sense feeling strapped after this buying \\r\\nbinge). Can you imagine an investor with $9.6 trillion selecting pile A over pile B? \\r\\n\\r\\nBeyond the staggering valuation given the existing stock of gold, current prices make today\\'s annual \\r\\nproduction of gold command about $160 billion. Buyers - whether jewelry and industrial users, \\r\\nfrightened individuals, or speculators - must continually absorb this additional supply to merely \\r\\nmaintain an equilibrium at present prices. \\r\\n\\r\\nA century from now the 400 million acres of farmland will have produced staggering amounts of corn, \\r\\nwheat, cotton, and other crops - and will continue to produce that valuable bounty, whatever the \\r\\ncurrency may be. Exxon Mobil will probably have delivered trillions of dollars in dividends to its \\r\\nowners and will also hold assets worth many more trillions (and, remember, you get 16 Exxons). The \\r\\n170,000 tons of gold will be unchanged in size and still incapable of producing anything. You can \\r\\nfondle the cube, but it will not respond. \\r\\n\\r\\nAdmittedly, when people a century from now are fearful, it\\'s likely many will still rush to gold. I\\'m \\r\\nconfident, however, that the $9.6 trillion current valuation of pile A will compound over the century at \\r\\na rate far inferior to that achieved by pile B. \\r\\n\\r\\nOur first two categories enjoy maximum popularity at peaks of fear: Terror over economic collapse \\r\\ndrives individuals to currency-based assets, most particularly U.S. obligations, and fear of currency \\r\\ncollapse fosters movement to sterile assets such as gold. We heard \"cash is king\" in late 2008, just \\r\\nwhen cash should have been deployed rather than held. Similarly, we heard \"cash is trash\" in the early \\r\\n1980s just when fixed-dollar investments were at their most attractive level in memory. On those \\r\\noccasions, investors who required a supportive crowd paid dearly for that comfort. \\r\\n\\r\\nMy own preference - and you knew this was coming - is our third category: investment in productive \\r\\nassets, whether businesses, farms, or real estate. Ideally, these assets should have the ability in \\r\\ninflationary times to deliver output that will retain its purchasing-power value while requiring a \\r\\nminimum of new capital investment. Farms, real estate, and many businesses such as Coca-Cola, IBM \\r\\nand our own See\\'s Candy meet that double-barreled test. Certain other companies - think of our \\r\\nregulated utilities, for example - fail it because inflation places heavy capital requirements on them. To \\r\\nearn more, their owners must invest more. Even so, these investments will remain superior to \\r\\nnonproductive or currency-based assets. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhether the currency a century from now is based on gold, seashells, shark teeth, or a piece of paper \\r\\n(as today), people will be willing to exchange a couple of minutes of their daily labor for a Coca-Cola \\r\\nor some See\\'s peanut brittle. In the future the U.S. population will move more goods, consume more \\r\\nfood, and require more living space than it does now. People will forever exchange what they produce \\r\\nfor what others produce. \\r\\n\\r\\nOur country\\'s businesses will continue to efficiently deliver goods and services wanted by our citizens. \\r\\nMetaphorically, these commercial \"cows\" will live for centuries and give ever greater quantities of \"milk\" \\r\\nto boot. Their value will be determined not by the medium of exchange but rather by their capacity to \\r\\ndeliver milk. Proceeds from the sale of the milk will compound for the owners of the cows, just as they \\r\\ndid during the 20 th century when the Dow increased from 66 to 11 ,497 (and paid loads of dividends as \\r\\nwell). Berkshire\\'s goal will be to increase its ownership of first-class businesses. Our first choice will be \\r\\nto own them in their entirety - but we will also be owners by way of holding sizable amounts of \\r\\nmarketable stocks. I believe that over any extended period of time this category of investing will prove to \\r\\nbe the runaway winner among the three we\\'ve examined. More important, it will be by far the safest. \\r\\n\\r\\n19 \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Annual Meeting \\r\\n\\r\\nThe annual meeting will be held on Saturday, May 5 th at the CenturyLink Center (renamed from \\r\\n\"Qwest\"). Last year, Carrie Kizer debuted as the ringmaster and earned a lifetime assignment. Everyone loved \\r\\nthe job she did - especially me. \\r\\n\\r\\nSoon after the 7 a.m. opening of the doors, we will have a new activity: The Newspaper Tossing Challenge. \\r\\nLate last year, Berkshire purchased the Omaha World-Herald and, in my meeting with its shareholder-employees, \\r\\nI told of the folding and throwing skills I developed while delivering 500,000 papers as a teenager. \\r\\n\\r\\nI immediately saw skepticism in the eyes of the audience. That was no surprise to me. After all, the \\r\\nreporters\\' mantra is: \"If your mother says she loves you, check it out.\" So now I have to back up my claim. At \\r\\nthe meeting, I will take on all comers in making 35-foot tosses of the World-Herald to a Clayton porch. Any \\r\\nchallenger whose paper lands closer to the doorstep than mine will receive a dilly bar. I\\'ve asked Dairy Queen to \\r\\nsupply several for the contest, though I doubt that any will be needed. We will have a large stack of papers. Grab \\r\\none. Fold it (no rubber bands). Take your best shot. Make my day. \\r\\n\\r\\nAt 8:30, a new Berkshire movie will be shown. An hour later, we will start the question-and-answer \\r\\nperiod, which (with a break for lunch at the CenturyLink\\' s stands) will last until 3:30. After a short recess, \\r\\nCharlie and I will convene the annual meeting at 3:45. If you decide to leave during the day\\'s question periods, \\r\\nplease do so while Charlie is talking. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe best reason to exit, of course, is to shop. We will help you do so by filling the 194,300-square-foot \\r\\nhall that adjoins the meeting area with products from dozens of Berkshire subsidiaries. Last year, you did your \\r\\npart, and most locations racked up record sales. In a nine-hour period, we sold 1,249 pairs of Justin boots, 11,254 \\r\\npounds of See\\'s candy, 8,000 Quikut knives (that\\'s 15 knives per minute) and 6,126 pairs of Wells Lamont \\r\\ngloves, a Marmon product whose very existence was news to me. (The product I focus on is money.) But you can \\r\\ndo better. Remember: Anyone who says money can\\'t buy happiness simply hasn\\'t shopped at our meeting. \\r\\n\\r\\nAmong the new exhibitors this year will be Brooks, our running-shoe company. Brooks has been \\r\\ngobbling up market share and in 201 1 had a sales gain of 34%, its tenth consecutive year of record volume. Drop \\r\\nby and congratulate Jim Weber, the company\\'s CEO. And be sure to buy a couple of pairs of limited edition \\r\\n\"Berkshire Hathaway Running Shoes.\" \\r\\n\\r\\nGEICO will have a booth staffed by a number of its top counselors from around the country, all of \\r\\nthem ready to supply you with auto insurance quotes. In most cases, GEICO will be able to give you a \\r\\nshareholder discount (usually 8%). This special offer is permitted by 44 of the 51 jurisdictions in which we \\r\\noperate. (One supplemental point: The discount is not additive if you qualify for another, such as that given \\r\\ncertain groups.) Bring the details of your existing insurance and check out whether we can save you money. For \\r\\nat least half of you, I believe we can. \\r\\n\\r\\nBe sure to visit the Bookworm. It will carry more than 35 books and DVDs, including a couple of new \\r\\nones. I recommend MiTek, an informative history of one of our very successful subsidiaries. You\\'ll learn how my \\r\\ninterest in the company was originally piqued by my receiving in the mail a hunk of ugly metal whose purpose I \\r\\ncouldn\\'t fathom. Since we bought MiTek in 2001, it has made 33 \"tuck-in\" acquisitions, almost all successful. I \\r\\nthink you\\'ll also like a short book that Peter Bevelin has put together explaining Berkshire\\'s investment and \\r\\noperating principles. It sums up what Charlie and I have been saying over the years in annual reports and at \\r\\nannual meetings. Should you need to ship your book purchases, a shipping service will be available nearby. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf you are a big spender - or aspire to become one - visit Elliott Aviation on the east side of the Omaha \\r\\nairport between noon and 5:00 p.m. on Saturday. There we will have a fleet of NetJets aircraft that will get your \\r\\npulse racing. Come by bus; leave by private jet. I\\'ll OK your credit. \\r\\n\\r\\nAn attachment to the proxy material that is enclosed with this report explains how you can obtain the \\r\\ncredential you will need for admission to the meeting and other events. Airlines have sometimes jacked up prices \\r\\nfor the Berkshire weekend. If you are coming from far away, compare the cost of flying to Kansas City versus \\r\\nOmaha. The drive between the two cities is about 2 V% hours, and it may be that you can save significant money, \\r\\nparticularly if you had planned to rent a car in Omaha. Spend the savings with us. \\r\\n\\r\\n20 \\r\\n\\r\\nAt Nebraska Furniture Mart, located on a 77-acre site on 72 nd Street between Dodge and Pacific, we \\r\\nwill again be having \"Berkshire Weekend\" discount pricing. Last year the store did $32.7 million of business \\r\\nduring its annual meeting sale, a volume that exceeds the yearly sales of most furniture stores. To obtain the \\r\\nBerkshire discount, you must make your purchases between Tuesday, May 1 st and Monday, May 7 th inclusive, \\r\\nand also present your meeting credential. The period\\'s special pricing will even apply to the products of several \\r\\nprestigious manufacturers that normally have ironclad rules against discounting but which, in the spirit of \\r\\nour shareholder weekend, have made an exception for you. We appreciate their cooperation. NFM is open \\r\\nfrom 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday through Saturday, and 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Sunday. On Saturday this year, from 5 :30 p.m. \\r\\nto 8 p.m., NFM is having a picnic to which you are all invited. \\r\\n\\r\\nAt Borsheims, we will again have two shareholder-only events. The first will be a cocktail reception \\r\\nfrom 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. on Friday, May 4 th . The second, the main gala, will be held on Sunday, May 6 th , from \\r\\n9 a.m. to 4 p.m. On Saturday, we will be open until 6 p.m. On Sunday, around 2 p.m., I will be clerking at \\r\\nBorsheims, desperate to beat my sales figure from last year. So come take advantage of me. Ask me for my \\r\\n\"Crazy Warren\" price. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe will have huge crowds at Borsheims throughout the weekend. For your convenience, therefore, \\r\\nshareholder prices will be available from Monday, April 30 th through Saturday, May 12 th . During that period, \\r\\nplease identify yourself as a shareholder by presenting your meeting credentials or a brokerage statement that \\r\\nshows you are a Berkshire holder. \\r\\n\\r\\nOn Sunday, in the mall outside of Borsheims, a blindfolded Patrick Wolff, twice U.S. chess champion, \\r\\nwill take on all comers - who will have their eyes wide open - in groups of six. Nearby, Norman Beck, a \\r\\nremarkable magician from Dallas, will bewilder onlookers. Additionally, we will have Bob Hamman and Sharon \\r\\nOsberg, two of the world\\'s top bridge experts, available to play bridge with our shareholders on Sunday \\r\\nafternoon. Two non-experts - Charlie and I - will also be at the tables. \\r\\n\\r\\nGorat\\'s and Piccolo\\'s will again be open exclusively for Berkshire shareholders on Sunday, May 6 th . \\r\\nBoth will be serving until 10 p.m., with Gorat\\'s opening at 1 p.m. and Piccolo\\'s opening at 4 p.m. These \\r\\nrestaurants are my favorites, and I will eat at both of them on Sunday evening. (Actuarial tables tell me that I can \\r\\nconsume another 12 million calories before my death. I\\'m terrified at the thought of leaving any of these behind, \\r\\nso will be frontloading on Sunday.) Remember: To make a reservation at Gorat\\'s, call 402-551-3733 on April 1 st \\r\\n(but not before) and at Piccolo\\'s, call 402-342-9038. At Piccolo\\'s, show some class and order a giant root beer \\r\\nfloat for dessert. Only sissies get the small one. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe will again have the same three financial journalists lead the question-and-answer period at the \\r\\nmeeting, asking Charlie and me questions that shareholders have submitted to them by e-mail. The journalists \\r\\nand their e-mail addresses are: Carol Loomis, of Fortune, who may be e-mailed at cloomis@fortunemail.com; \\r\\nBecky Quick, of CNBC, at BerkshireQuestions@cnbc.com, and Andrew Ross Sorkin, of The New York Times, \\r\\nat arsorkin@nytimes.com. \\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the questions submitted, each journalist will choose the dozen or so he or she decides are the \\r\\nmost interesting and important. The journalists have told me your question has the best chance of being selected \\r\\nif you keep it concise, avoid sending it in at the last moment, make it Berkshire-related and include no more than \\r\\ntwo questions in any e-mail you send them. (In your e-mail, let the journalist know if you would like your name \\r\\nmentioned if your question is selected.) \\r\\n\\r\\nThis year we are adding a second panel of three financial analysts who follow Berkshire. They are Cliff \\r\\nGallant of KBW, Jay Gelb of Barclays Capital and Gary Ransom of Dowling and Partners. These analysts will \\r\\nbring their own Berkshire- specific questions and alternate with the journalists and the audience. \\r\\n\\r\\nCharlie and I believe that all shareholders should have access to new Berkshire information simultaneously \\r\\nand should also have adequate time to analyze it, which is why we try to issue financial information after the market \\r\\nclose on a Friday. We do not talk one-on-one to large institutional investors or analysts. Our new panel will let \\r\\nanalysts ask questions - perhaps even a few technical ones - in a manner that may be helpful to many shareholders. \\r\\n\\r\\n21 \\r\\n\\r\\nNeither Charlie nor I will get so much as a clue about the questions to be asked. We know the \\r\\njournalists and analysts will come up with some tough ones, and that\\'s the way we like it. All told, we expect at \\r\\nleast 54 questions, which will allow for six from each analyst and journalist and 18 from the audience. If there is \\r\\nsome extra time, we will take more from the audience. Audience questioners will be determined by drawings that \\r\\nwill take place at 8:15 a.m. at each of the 13 microphones located in the arena and main overflow room. \\r\\n\\r\\nFor good reason, I regularly extol the accomplishments of our operating managers. They are truly \\r\\nAll-Stars, who run their businesses as if they were the only asset owned by their families. I believe their mindset \\r\\nto be as shareholder-oriented as can be found in the universe of large publicly-owned companies. Most have no \\r\\nfinancial need to work; the joy of hitting business \"home runs\" means as much to them as their paycheck. \\r\\n\\r\\nEqually important, however, are the 23 men and women who work with me at our corporate office (all \\r\\non one floor, which is the way we intend to keep it!). \\r\\n\\r\\nThis group efficiently deals with a multitude of SEC and other regulatory requirements and files a \\r\\n17,839-page Federal income tax return - hello, Guinness! - as well as state and foreign returns. Additionally, \\r\\nthey respond to countless shareholder and media inquiries, get out the annual report, prepare for the country\\'s \\r\\nlargest annual meeting, coordinate the Board\\'s activities - and the list goes on and on. \\r\\n\\r\\nThey handle all of these business tasks cheerfully and with unbelievable efficiency, making my life easy \\r\\nand pleasant. Their efforts go beyond activities strictly related to Berkshire: They deal with 48 universities (selected \\r\\nfrom 200 applicants) who will send students to Omaha this school year for a day with me and also handle all kinds \\r\\nof requests that I receive, arrange my travel, and even get me hamburgers for lunch. No CEO has it better. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis home office crew, along with our operating managers, has my deepest thanks and deserves yours \\r\\nas well. Come to Omaha - the cradle of capitalism - on May 5 th and tell them so. \\r\\n\\r\\nFebruary 25, 2012 Warren E. Buffett \\r\\n\\r\\nChairman of the Board \\r\\n\\r\\n1 \\r\\n\\r\\n22 \\r\\n'"

              "\"berkshire hathaway inc. to the shareholders of berkshire hathaway inc. our gain in net worth during #### was ##.# billion which increased the pershare book value of both our class a and class b stock by ##.#%. over the last ## years that is since present management took over book value has grown from ## to ##### a rate of ##.#% compounded annually. we believe that ##.# billion is a record for a oneyear gain in net worth  more than has ever been booked by any american business leaving aside boosts that have occurred because of mergers e.g. aol's purchase of time warner. of course exxon mobil and other companies earn far more than berkshire but their earnings largely go to dividends andor repurchases rather than to building net worth. all that said a confession about our #### gain is in order. our most important business insurance benefited from a large dose of luck mother nature bless her heart went on vacation. after hammering us with hurricanes in #### and ####  storms that caused us to lose a bundle on supercat insurance  she just vanished. last year the red ink from this activity turned black  very black. in addition the great majority of our ## businesses did outstandingly well in ####. let me focus for a moment on one of our largest operations geico. what management accomplished there was simply extraordinary. as i've told you before tony nicely geico' s ceo went to work at the company ## years ago two months after turning ##. he became ceo in #### and from then on the company's growth exploded. in addition tony has delivered staggering productivity gains in recent years. between yearend #### and yearend #### the number of geico policies increased from #.# million to #.# million a jump of ##%. yet during that same period the company's employees measured on a fulltimeequivalent basis fell #.#%. so productivity grew ##%. and geico didn't start fat. that remarkable gain has allowed geico to maintain its allimportant position as a lowcost producer even though it has dramatically increased advertising expenditures. last year geico spent ### million on ads up from ### million in #### and up from ## million in #### when berkshire took control. today geico spends far more on ads than any of its competitors even those much larger. we will continue to raise the bar. last year i told you that if you had a new son or grandson to be sure to name him tony. but don keough a berkshire director recently had a better idea. after reviewing geico's performance in #### he wrote me forget births. tell the shareholders to immediately change the names of their present children to tony or antoinette. don signed his letter tony. charlie munger  my partner and berkshire's vice chairman  and i run what has turned out to be a big business one with ###### employees and annual revenues approaching ### billion. we certainly didn't plan it that way. charlie began as a lawyer and i thought of myself as a security analyst. sitting in those seats we both grew skeptical about the ability of big entities of any type to function well. size seems to make many organizations slowthinking resistant to change and smug. in churchill's words we shape our buildings and afterwards our buildings shape us. here's a telling fact of the ten nonoil companies having the largest market capitalization in ####  titans such as general motors sears dupont and eastman kodak  only one made the #### list. a## pershare figures used in this report apply to berkshire's a shares. figures for the b shares are ### of those shown for the a. # in fairness we've seen plenty of successes as well some truly outstanding. there are many giant company managers whom i greatly admire ken chenault of american express jeff immelt of g.e. and dick kovacevich of wells fargo come quickly to mind. but i don't think i could do the management job they do. and i know i wouldn't enjoy many of the duties that come with their positions  meetings speeches foreign travel the charity circuit and governmental relations. for me ronald reagan had it right it's probably true that hard work never killed anyone  but why take the chance so i've taken the easy route just sitting back and working through great managers who run their own shows. my only tasks are to cheer them on sculpt and harden our corporate culture and make major capitalallocation decisions. our managers have returned this trust by working hard and effectively. for their performance over the last ## years  and particularly for ####  charlie and i thank them. yardsticks charlie and i measure berkshire's progress and evaluate its intrinsic value in a number of ways. no single criterion is effective in doing these jobs and even an avalanche of statistics will not capture some factors that are important. for example it's essential that we have managers much younger than i available to succeed me. berkshire has never been in better shape in this regard  but i can't prove it to you with numbers. there are two statistics however that are of real importance. the first is the amount of investments including cash and cashequivalents that we own on a pershare basis. arriving at this figure we exclude investments held in our finance operation because these are largely offset by borrowings. here's the record since present management acquired control of berkshire year pershare investments  ####  # #### ### #### #### #### ##### #### ##### compound growth rate ######## ##.#% compound growth rate ######## ##.#% net of minority interests in our early years we put most of our retained earnings and insurance float into investments in marketable securities. because of this emphasis and because the securities we purchased generally did well our growth rate in investments was for a long time quite high. over the years however we have focused more and more on the acquisition of operating businesses. using our funds for these purchases has both slowed our growth in investments and accelerated our gains in pretax earnings from noninsurance businesses the second yardstick we use. here's how those earnings have looked # year pretax earnings per share  ####  # #### # #### ## #### ### #### #### compound growth rate ######## ##.#% compound growth rate ######## ##.#% excluding purchaseaccounting adjustments and net of minority interests last year we had a good increase in noninsurance earnings  ##%. large gains from here on in though will come only if we are able to make major and sensible acquisitions. that will not be easy. we do however have one advantage more and more berkshire has become the buyer of choice for business owners and managers. initially we were viewed that way only in the u.s. and more often than not by private companies. we've long wanted nonetheless to extend berkshire's appeal beyond u.s. borders. and last year our globetrotting finally got underway. acquisitions we began #### by completing the three acquisitions pending at yearend #### spending about # billion for pacificorp business wire and applied underwriters. all are performing very well. the highlight of the year however was our july # th acquisition of most of iscar an israeli company and our new association with its chairman eitan wertheimer and ceo jacob harpaz. the story here began on october ## #### when i received a ###page letter from eitan of whom i then knew nothing. the letter began i am writing to introduce you to iscar and proceeded to describe a cutting tool business carried on in ## countries. then eitan wrote we have for some time considered the issues of generational transfer and ownership that are typical for large family enterprises and have given much thought to iscar' s future. our conclusion is that berkshire hathaway would be the ideal home for iscar. we believe that iscar would continue to thrive as a part of your portfolio of businesses. overall eitan' s letter made the quality of the company and the character of its management leap off the page. it also made me want to learn more and in november eitan jacob and iscar' s cfo danny goldman came to omaha. a few hours with them convinced me that if we were to make a deal we would be teaming up with extraordinarily talented managers who could be trusted to run the business after a sale with all of the energy and dedication that they had exhibited previously. however having never bought a business based outside of the u.s. though i had bought a number of foreign stocks i needed to get educated on some tax and jurisdictional matters. with that task completed berkshire purchased ##% of iscar for # billion. the remaining ##% stays in the hands of the wertheimer family making it our valued partner. iscar' s products are small consumable cutting tools that are used in conjunction with large and expensive machine tools. it's a business without magic except for that imparted by the people who run it. but eitan jacob and their associates are true managerial magicians who constantly develop tools that make their customers' machines more productive. the result iscar makes money because it enables its customers to make more money. there is no better recipe for continued success. # in september charlie and i along with five berkshire associates visited iscar in israel. we  and i mean every one of us  have never been more impressed with any operation. at iscar as throughout israel brains and energy are ubiquitous. berkshire shareholders are lucky to have joined with eitan jacob danny and their talented associates. a few months later berkshire again became the buyer of choice in a deal brought to us by my friend john roach of fort worth. john many of you will remember was chairman of justin industries which we bought in ####. at that time john was helping john justin who was terminally ill find a permanent home for his company. john justin died soon after we bought justin industries but it has since been run exactly as we promised him it would be. visiting me in november john roach brought along paul andrews jr. owner of about ##% of tti a fort worth distributor of electronic components. over a ##year period paul built tti from ###### of sales to #.# billion. he is a remarkable entrepreneur and operator. paul ## loves running his business. but not long ago he happened to witness how disruptive the death of a founder can be both to a private company's employees and the owner's family. what starts out as disruptive furthermore often evolves into destructive. about a year ago therefore paul began to think about selling tti. his goal was to put his business in the hands of an owner he had carefully chosen rather than allowing a trust officer or lawyer to conduct an auction after his death. paul rejected the idea of a strategic buyer knowing that in the pursuit of synergies an owner of that type would be apt to dismantle what he had so carefully built a move that would uproot hundreds of his associates and perhaps wound tti's business in the process. he also ruled out a private equity firm which would very likely load the company with debt and then flip it as soon as possible. that left berkshire. paul and i met on the morning of november ## th and made a deal before lunch. later he wrote me after our meeting i am confident that berkshire is the right owner for tti . . . i am proud of our past and excited about our future. and so are charlie and i. we also made some tuckin acquisitions during #### at fruit of the loom fruit mitek ctb shaw and clayton. fruit made the largest purchases. first it bought russell corp. a leading producer of athletic apparel and uniforms for about #.# billion including assumed debt and in december it agreed to buy the intimate apparel business of vf corp. together these acquisitions add about #.# billion to fruit's sales and bring with them about ##### employees. charlie and i love it when we can acquire businesses that can be placed under managers such as john holland at fruit who have already shown their stuff at berkshire. mitek for example has made ## acquisitions since we purchased it in #### and gene toombs has delivered results from these deals far in excess of what he had predicted. in effect we leverage the managerial talent already with us by these tuck in deals. we will make many more. we continue however to need elephants in order for us to use berkshire's flood of incoming cash. charlie and i must therefore ignore the pursuit of mice and focus our acquisition efforts on much bigger game. our exemplar is the older man who crashed his grocery cart into that of a much younger fellow while both were shopping. the elderly man explained apologetically that he had lost track of his wife and was preoccupied searching for her. his new acquaintance said that by coincidence his wife had also wandered off and suggested that it might be more efficient if they jointly looked for the two women. agreeing the older man asked his new companion what his wife looked like. she's a gorgeous blonde the fellow answered with a body that would cause a bishop to go through a stained glass window and she's wearing tight white shorts. how about yours the senior citizen wasted no words forget her we'll look for yours. # what we are looking for is described on page ##. if you have an acquisition candidate that fits call me  day or night. and then watch me shatter a stained glass window. now let's examine the four major operating sectors of berkshire. lumping their financial figures together impedes analysis. so we'll look at them as four separate businesses starting with the all important insurance group. insurance next month marks the ## th anniversary of our entrance into the insurance business. it was on march # #### that berkshire purchased national indemnity and its companion company national fire  marine from jack ringwalt for #.# million. jack was a longtime friend of mine and an excellent but somewhat eccentric businessman. for about ten minutes every year he would get the urge to sell his company. but those moods  perhaps brought on by a tiff with regulators or an unfavorable jury verdict  quickly vanished. in the mid####s i asked investment banker charlie heider a mutual friend of mine and jack's to alert me the next time jack was in heat. when charlie's call came i sped to meet jack. we made a deal in a few minutes with me waiving an audit due diligence or anything else that would give jack an opportunity to reconsider. we just shook hands and that was that. when we were due to close the purchase at charlie's office jack was late. finally arriving he explained that he had been driving around looking for a parking meter with some unexpired time. that was a magic moment for me. i knew then that jack was going to be my kind of manager. when berkshire purchased jack's two insurers they had float of ## million. we've regularly offered a long explanation of float in earlier reports which you can read on our website. simply put float is money we hold that is not ours but which we get to invest. at the end of #### our float had grown to ##.# billion and we have since written a huge retroactive reinsurance contract with equitas  which i will describe in the next section  that boosts float by another # billion. much of the gain we've made has come through our acquisition of other insurers but we've also had outstanding internal growth particularly at ajit jain's amazing reinsurance operation. naturally i had no notion in #### that our float would develop as it has. there's much to be said for just putting one foot in front of the other every day. the float from retroactive reinsurance contracts of which we have many automatically drifts down over time. therefore it will be difficult for us to increase float in the future unless we make new acquisitions in the insurance field. whatever its size however the allimportant cost of berkshire's float over time is likely to be significantly below that of the industry perhaps even falling to less than zero. note the words over time. there will be bad years periodically. you can be sure of that. in #### though everything went right in insurance  really right. our managers  tony nicely geico ajit jain bh reinsurance joe brandon and tad montross general re don wurster national indemnity primary tom nerney u.s. liability tim kenesey medical protective rod eldred homestate companies and cypress sid ferenc and steve menzies applied underwriters john kizer central states and don towle kansas bankers surety  simply shot the lights out. when i recite their names i feel as if i'm at cooperstown reading from the hall of fame roster. of course the overall insurance industry also had a terrific year in ####. but our managers delivered results generally superior to those of their competitors. # below is the tally on our underwriting and float for each major sector of insurance. enjoy the view because you won't soon see another like it. in  millions underwriting profit loss yearend float insurance operations #### #### general re  ###  ### bh reinsurance #### ####

second question is yes #### will soon be perceived as a misleading period of calm preceding a series of devastating storms. these could rock the insurance industry. it's naive to think of katrina as anything close to a worstcase event. neither ajit jain who manages our supercat operation nor i know what lies ahead. we do know that it would be a huge mistake to bet that evolving atmospheric changes are benign in their implications for insurers. don't think however that we have lost our taste for risk. we remain prepared to lose # billion in a single event ifwe have been paid appropriately for assuming that risk. we are not willing though to take on even very small exposures at prices that don't reflect our evaluation of loss probabilities. appropriate prices don't guarantee profits in any given year but inappropriate prices most certainly guarantee eventual losses. rates have recently fallen because a flood of capital has entered the supercat field. we have therefore sharply reduced our wind exposures. our behavior here parallels that which we employ in financial markets be fearful when others are greedy and be greedy when others are fearful. lloyd's equitas and retroactive reinsurance last year  we are getting now to equitas  berkshire agreed to enter into a huge retroactive reinsurance contract a policy that protects an insurer against losses that have already happened but whose cost is not yet known. i'll give you details of the agreement shortly. but let's first take a journey through insurance history following the route that led to our deal. our tale begins around #### when edward lloyd opened a small coffee house in london. though no starbucks his shop was destined to achieve worldwide fame because of the commercial activities of its clientele  shipowners merchants and venturesome british capitalists. as these parties sipped edward's brew they began to write contracts transferring the risk of a disaster at sea from the owners of ships and their cargo to the capitalists who wagered that a given voyage would be completed without incident. these capitalists eventually became known as underwriters at lloyd's. though many people believe lloyd's to be an insurance company that is not the case. it is instead a place where many memberinsurers transact business just as they did centuries ago. over time the underwriters solicited passive investors to join in syndicates. additionally the business broadened beyond marine risks into every imaginable form of insurance including exotic coverages that spread the fame of lloyd's far and wide. the underwriters left the coffee house found grander quarters and formalized some rules of association. and those persons who passively backed the underwriters became known as names. # eventually the names came to include many thousands of people from around the world who joined expecting to pick up some extra change without effort or serious risk. true prospective names were always solemnly told that they would have unlimited and everlasting liability for the consequences of their syndicate's underwriting  down to the last cufflink as the quaint description went. but that warning came to be viewed as perfunctory. three hundred years of retained cufflinks acted as a powerful sedative to the names poised to sign up. then came asbestos. when its prospective costs were added to the tidal wave of environmental and product claims that surfaced in the ####s lloyd's began to implode. policies written decades earlier  and largely forgotten about  were developing huge losses. no one could intelligently estimate their total but it was certain to be many tens of billions of dollars. the specter of unending and unlimited losses terrified existing names and scared away prospects. many names opted for bankruptcy some even chose suicide. from these shambles there came a desperate effort to resuscitate lloyd's. in #### the powers that be at the institution allotted ##.# billion to a new company equitas and made it responsible for paying all claims on policies written before ####. in effect this plan pooled the misery of the many syndicates in trouble. of course the money allotted could prove to be insufficient  and if that happened the names remained liable for the shortfall. but the new plan by concentrating all of the liabilities in one place had the advantage of eliminating much of the costly intramural squabbling that went on among syndicates. moreover the pooling allowed claims evaluation negotiation and litigation to be handled more intelligently than had been the case previously. equitas embraced ben franklin's thinking we must all hang together or assuredly we shall hang separately. from the start many people predicted equitas would eventually fail. but as ajit and i reviewed the facts in the spring of ####  ## years after the last exposed policy had been written and after the payment of ##.# billion in claims  we concluded that the patient was likely to survive. and so we decided to offer a huge reinsurance policy to equitas. because plenty of imponderables continue to exist berkshire could not provide equitas and its ##### names unlimited protection. but we said  and i'm simplifying  that if equitas would give us #.## billion in cash and securities this is the float i spoke about we would pay all of its future claims and expenses up to ##.# billion. that amount was #.# billion above what equitas had recently guessed its ultimate liabilities to be. thus the names received a huge  and almost certainly sufficient  amount of future protection against unpleasant surprises. indeed the protection is so large that equitas plans a cash payment to its thousands of names an event few of them had ever dreamed possible. and how will berkshire fare that depends on how much known claims will end up costing us how many yettobepresented claims will surface and what they will cost how soon claim payments will be made and how much we earn on the cash we receive before it must be paid out. ajit and i think the odds are in our favor. and should we be wrong berkshire can handle it. scott moser the ceo of equitas summarized the transaction neatly names wanted to sleep easy at night and we think we've just bought them the world's best mattress. warning it's time to eat your broccoli  i am now going to talk about accounting matters. i owe this to those berkshire shareholders who love reading about debits and credits. i hope both of you find this discussion helpful. all others can skip this section there will be no quiz. berkshire has done many retroactive transactions  in both number and amount a multiple of such policies entered into by any other insurer. we are the reinsurer of choice for these coverages because the obligations that are transferred to us  for example lifetime indemnity and medical payments to be made to injured workers  may not be fully satisfied for ## years or more. no other company can offer the certainty # that berkshire can in terms of guaranteeing the full and fair settlement of these obligations. this fact is important to the original insurer policyholders and regulators. the accounting procedure for retroactive transactions is neither well known nor intuitive. the best way for shareholders to understand it therefore is for us to simply lay out the debits and credits. charlie and i would like to see this done more often. we sometimes encounter accounting footnotes about important transactions that leave us baffled and we go away suspicious that the reporting company wished it that way. for example try comprehending transactions described in the old ##ks of enron even after you know how the movie ended. so let us summarize our accounting for the equitas transaction. the major debits will be to cash and investments reinsurance recoverable and deferred charges for reinsurance assumed dcra. the major credit will be to reserve for losses and loss adjustment expense. no profit or loss will be recorded at the inception of the transaction but underwriting losses will thereafter be incurred annually as the dcra asset is amortized downward. the amount of the annual amortization charge will be primarily determined by how our endoftheyear estimates as to the timing and amount of future loss payments compare to the estimates made at the beginning of the year. eventually when the last claim has been paid the dcra account will be reduced to zero. that day is ## years or more away. what's important to remember is that retroactive insurance contracts always produce underwriting losses for us. whether these losses are worth experiencing depends on whether the cash we have received produces investment income that exceeds the losses. recently our dcra charges have annually delivered ### million or so of underwriting losses which have been more than offset by the income we have realized through use of the cash we received as a premium. absent new retroactive contracts the amount of the annual charge would normally decline over time. after the equitas transaction however the annual dcra cost will initially increase to about ### million a year. this means that our other insurance operations must generate at least that much underwriting gain for our overall float to be costfree. that amount is quite a hurdle but one that i believe we will clear in many if not most years. aren't you glad that i promised you there would be no quiz manufacturing service and retailing operations our activities in this part of berkshire cover the waterfront. let's look though at a summary balance sheet and earnings statement for the entire group. balance sheet ###### in millions assets cash and equivalents accounts and

motor homes earned a pleasing ##% on average tangible net worth last year. it's noteworthy also that these operations used only minor financial leverage in achieving that return. clearly we own some terrific businesses. we purchased many of them however at large premiums to net worth  a point reflected in the goodwill item shown on the balance sheet  and that fact reduces the earnings on our average carrying value to ##.#%. here are a few newsworthy items about companies in this sector  bob shaw a remarkable entrepreneur who from a standing start built shaw industries into the country's largest carpet producer elected last year at age ## to retire. to succeed him bob recommended vance bell a ##year veteran at shaw and bob as usual made the right call. weakness in housing has caused the carpet business to slow. shaw however remains a powerhouse and a major contributor to berkshire's earnings.  mitek a manufacturer of connectors for roof trusses at the time we purchased it in #### is developing into a miniconglomerate. at the rate it is growing in fact mini may soon be inappropriate. in purchasing mitek for ### million we lent the company ### million at #% and bought ### million of stock priced at ##### per share. additionally ## employees bought #### shares for ## million. each employee paid exactly the same price that we did in most cases borrowing money to do so. and are they ever glad they did five years later mitek' s sales have tripled and the stock is valued at ##### per share. despite its making ## acquisitions at a cost of ### million mitek has paid off its debt to berkshire and holds ## million of cash. we celebrated the fifth anniversary of our purchase with a party in july. i told the group that it would be embarrassing if mitek's stock price soared beyond that of berkshire a shares. don't be surprised however if that happens though charlie and i will try to make our shares a moving target.  not all of our businesses are destined to increase profits. when an industry's underlying economics are crumbling talented management may slow the rate of decline. eventually though eroding fundamentals will overwhelm managerial brilliance. as a wise friend told me long ago if you want to get a reputation as a good businessman be sure to get into a good business. and fundamentals are definitely eroding in the newspaper industry a trend that has caused the profits of our buffalo news to decline. the skid will almost certainly continue. when charlie and i were young the newspaper business was as easy a way to make huge returns as existed in america. as one nottoobright publisher famously said i owe my fortune to two great american institutions monopoly and nepotism. no paper in a one paper city however bad the product or however inept the management could avoid gushing profits. the industry's staggering returns could be simply explained. for most of the ## th century newspapers were the primary source of information for the american public. whether the subject was sports finance or politics newspapers reigned supreme. just as important their ads were the easiest way to find job opportunities or to learn the price of groceries at your town's supermarkets. ## the great majority of families therefore felt the need for a paper every day but understandably most didn't wish to pay for two. advertisers preferred the paper with the most circulation and readers tended to want the paper with the most ads and news pages. this circularity led to a law of the newspaper jungle survival of the fattest. thus when two or more papers existed in a major city which was almost universally the case a century ago the one that pulled ahead usually emerged as the standalone winner. after competition disappeared the paper's pricing power in both advertising and circulation was unleashed. typically rates for both advertisers and readers would be raised annually  and the profits rolled in. for owners this was economic heaven. interestingly though papers regularly  and often in a disapproving way  reported on the profitability of say the auto or steel industries they never enlightened readers about their own midaslike situation. hmmm . . . as long ago as my #### letter to shareholders i nonetheless asserted that this insulated world was changing writing that the media businesses . . . will prove considerably less marvelous than i the industry or lenders thought would be the case only a few years ago. some publishers took umbrage at both this remark and other warnings from me that followed. newspaper properties moreover continued to sell as if they were indestructible slot machines. in fact many intelligent newspaper executives who regularly chronicled and analyzed important worldwide events were either blind or indifferent to what was going on under their noses. now however almost all newspaper owners realize that they are constantly losing ground in the battle for eyeballs. simply put if cable and satellite broadcasting as well as the internet had come along first newspapers as we know them probably would never have existed. in berkshire's world stan lipsey does a terrific job running the buffalo news and i am enormously proud of its editor margaret sullivan. the news' penetration of its market is the highest among that of this country's large newspapers. we also do better financially than most metropolitan newspapers even though buffalo's population and business trends are not good. nevertheless this operation faces unrelenting pressures that will cause profit margins to slide. true we have the leading online news operation in buffalo and it will continue to attract more viewers and ads. however the economic potential of a newspaper internet site  given the many alternative sources of information and entertainment that are free and only a click away  is at best a small fraction of that existing in the past for a print newspaper facing no competition. for a local resident ownership of a city's paper like ownership of a sports team still produces instant prominence. with it typically comes power and influence. these are ruboffs that appeal to many people with money. beyond that civicminded wealthy individuals may feel that local ownership will serve their community well. that's why peter kiewit bought the omaha paper more than ## years ago. we are likely therefore to see noneconomic individual buyers of newspapers emerge just as we have seen such buyers acquire major sports franchises. aspiring press lords should be careful however there's no rule that says a newspaper's revenues can't fall below its expenses and that losses can't mushroom. fixed costs are high in the newspaper business and that's bad news when unit volume heads south. as the importance of newspapers diminishes moreover the psychic value of possessing one will wane whereas owning a sports franchise will likely retain its cachet. unless we face an irreversible cash drain we will stick with the news just as we've said that we would. read economic principle # # on page ##. charlie and i love newspapers  we each read five a day  and believe that a free and energetic press is a key ingredient for maintaining a great democracy. we hope that some combination of print and online will ward off economic doomsday for newspapers and we will work hard in buffalo to develop a sustainable business model. i think we will be successful. but the days of lush profits from our newspaper are over. ##  a much improved situation is emerging at netjets which sells and manages fractionallyowned aircraft. this company has never had a problem growing revenues from flight operations have increased ###% since our purchase in ####. but profits had been erratic. our move to europe which began in #### was particularly expensive. after five years of operation there we had acquired only ## customers. and by midyear #### our cumulative pre tax loss had risen to ### million. but european demand has now exploded with a net of ### customers having been added in ########. under mark booth's brilliant leadership netjets is now operating profitably in europe and we expect the positive trend to continue. our u.s. operation also had a good year in #### which led to worldwide pretax earnings of ### million at netjets last year. we made this profit even though we suffered a loss of ## million in the first quarter. credit rich santulli along with mark for this turnaround. rich like many of our managers has no financial need to work. but you'd never know it. he's absolutely tireless  monitoring operations making sales and traveling the globe to constantly widen the alreadyenormous lead that netjets enjoys over its competitors. today the value of the fleet we manage is far greater than that managed by our three largest competitors combined. there's a reason netjets is the runaway leader it offers the ultimate in safety and service. at berkshire and at a number of our subsidiaries netjets aircraft are an indispensable business tool. i also have a contract for personal use with netjets and so do members of my family and most berkshire directors. none of us i should add gets a discount. once you've flown netjets returning to commercial flights is like going back to holding hands. regulated utility business berkshire has an ##.#% fully diluted interest in midamerican energy holdings which owns a wide variety of utility operations. the largest of these are # yorkshire electricity and northern electric whose #.# million electric customers make it the third largest distributor of electricity in the u.k. # midamerican energy which serves ###### electric customers primarily in iowa # pacific power and rocky mountain power serving about #.# million electric customers in six western states and # kern river and northern natural pipelines which carry about #% of the natural gas consumed in the u.s. our partners in ownership of midamerican are walter scott and its two terrific managers dave sokol and greg abel. it's unimportant how many votes each party has we will make major moves only when we are unanimous in thinking them wise. six years of working with dave greg and walter have underscored my original belief berkshire couldn't have better partners. somewhat incongruously midamerican owns the second largest real estate brokerage firm in the u.s. homeservices of america. this company operates through ## locallybranded firms with ##### agents. despite homeservices' purchase of two operations last year the company's overall volume fell #% to ## billion and profits fell ##%. the slowdown in residential real estate activity stems in part from the weakened lending practices of recent years. the optional contracts and teaser rates that have been popular have allowed borrowers to make payments in the early years of their mortgages that fall far short of covering normal interest costs. naturally there are few defaults when virtually nothing is required of a borrower. as a cynic has said a rolling loan gathers no loss. but payments not made add to principal and borrowers who can't afford normal monthly payments early on are hit later with abovenormal monthly obligations. this is the scarlett o'hara scenario i'll think about that tomorrow. for many home owners tomorrow has now arrived. consequently there is a huge overhang of offerings in several of homeservices' markets. nevertheless we will be seeking to purchase additional brokerage operations. a decade from now homeservices will almost certainly be much larger. ## here are some key figures on midamerican' s operations earnings in  millions #### #### u.k. utilities  ###  ### iowa utility ### ### western utilities acquired march ##

re's derivative operation. when we started to wind this business down early in #### we had ##### contracts outstanding. now we have ###. our cumulative pretax loss from this operation totals ### million but only # million occurred in ####. charlie says that if we had properly classified the ### million on our #### balance sheet it would have been labeled good until reached for. in any event a shakespearean thought  slightly modified  seems appropriate for the tombstone of this derivative business all's well that ends. we've also wound up our investment in value capital. so earnings or losses from these two lines of business are making their final appearance in the table that annually appears in this section. clayton homes remains an anomaly in the manufacturedhousing industry which last year recorded its lowest unit sales since ####. indeed the industry's volume last year was only about onethird that of ####. outside of clayton i doubt if the industry overall made any money in ####. yet clayton earned ### million pretax and paid berkshire an additional ## million as a fee for our obtaining the funds to finance clayton's ## billion portfolio of installment receivables. berkshire's financial strength has clearly been of huge help to clayton. but the driving force behind the company's success is kevin clayton. kevin knows the business forward and backward is a rational decisionmaker and a joy to work with. because of acquisitions clayton now employs ##### people compared to #### at the time of our purchase. we have two leasing operations cort furniture run by paul arnold and xtra truck trailers run by bill franz. cort's earnings improved significantly last year and xtra's remained at the high level attained in ####. we continue to look for tuckin acquisitions to be run by paul or bill and also are open to ideas for new leasing opportunities. ## here's a breakdown of earnings in this sector in millions pretax earnings interestbearing

#% and ##%. these are stellar results and we thank their ceos. we've come close to eliminating our direct foreignexchange position from which we realized about ### million in pretax profits in #### earnings that were included in the finance and financial products table shown earlier. that brought our total gain since inception of this position in #### to #.# billion. here's a breakdown by currency total gain loss in millions australian dollar ###.# mexican peso ###.# british pound ###.# new zealand dollar ###.# canadian dollar ###.# singapore dollar #.# chinese yuan ##.# south korean won ###.# euro ###.# swiss franc #.# hong kong dollar #.# taiwan dollar ##.# japanese yen # .# miscellaneous options ##.# we've made large indirect currency profits as well though i've never tallied the precise amount. for example in ######## we spent about ## million buying  of all things  enron bonds some of which were denominated in euros. already we've received distributions of ### million from these bonds and our remaining stake is worth ### million. that means our overall gain is ### million part of which came from the appreciation of the euro that took place after our bond purchase. when we first began making foreign exchange purchases interestrate differentials between the u.s. and most foreign countries favored a direct currency position. but that spread turned negative in ####. we therefore looked for other ways to gain foreigncurrency exposure such as the ownership of foreign equities or of u.s. stocks with major earnings abroad. the currency factor we should emphasize is not dominant in our selection of equities but is merely one of many considerations. as our u.s. trade problems worsen the probability that the dollar will weaken over time continues to be high. i fervently believe in real trade  the more the better for both us and the world. we had about #.## trillion of this honesttogod trade in ####. but the u.s. also had .## trillion of pseudotmde last year  imports for which we exchanged no goods or services. ponder for a moment how commentators would describe the situation if our imports were .## trillion  a full #% of gdp  and we had no exports. making these purchases that weren't reciprocated by sales the u.s. necessarily transferred ownership of its assets or ious to the rest of the world. like a very wealthy but selfindulgent family we peeled off a bit of what we owned in order to consume more than we produced. the u.s. can do a lot of this because we are an extraordinarily rich country that has behaved responsibly in the past. the world is therefore willing to accept our bonds real estate stocks and businesses. and we have a vast store of these to hand over. these transfers will have consequences however. already the prediction i made last year about one fallout from our spending binge has come true the investment income account of our country  positive in every previous year since ####  turned negative in ####. foreigners now earn more on their u.s. investments than we do on our investments abroad. in effect we've used up our bank account and turned to our credit card. and like everyone who gets in hock the u.s. will now experience reverse compounding as we pay everincreasing amounts of interest on interest. i want to emphasize that even though our course is unwise americans will live better ten or twenty years from now than they do today. percapita wealth will increase. but our citizens will also be forced every year to ship a significant portion of their current production abroad merely to service the cost of our huge debtor position. it won't be pleasant to work part of each day to pay for the overconsumption ## of your ancestors. i believe that at some point in the future u.s. workers and voters will find this annual tribute so onerous that there will be a severe political backlash. how that will play out in markets is impossible to predict  but to expect a soft landing seems like wishful thinking. i should mention that all of the direct currency profits we have realized have come from forward contracts which are derivatives and that we have entered into other types of derivatives contracts as well. that may seem odd since you know of our expensive experience in unwinding the derivatives book at gen re and also have heard me talk of the systemic problems that could result from the enormous growth in the use of derivatives. why you may wonder are we fooling around with such potentially toxic material the answer is that derivatives just like stocks and bonds are sometimes wildly mispriced. for many years accordingly we have selectively written derivative contracts  few in number but sometimes for large dollar amounts. we currently have ## contracts outstanding. i manage them personally and they are free of counterparty credit risk. so far these derivative contracts have worked out well for us producing pretax profits in the hundreds of millions of dollars above and beyond the gains i've itemized from forward foreignexchange contracts. though we will experience losses from time to time we are likely to continue to earn  overall  significant profits from mispriced derivatives. i have told you that berkshire has three outstanding candidates to replace me as ceo and that the board knows exactly who should take over if i should die tonight. each of the three is much younger than i. the directors believe it's important that my successor have the prospect of a long tenure. frankly we are not as wellprepared on the investment side of our business. there's a history here at one time charlie was my potential replacement for investing and more recently lou simpson has filled that slot. lou is a topnotch investor with an outstanding longterm record of managing geico's equity portfolio. but he is only six years younger than i. if i were to die soon he would fill in magnificently for a short period. for the longterm though we need a different answer. at our october board meeting we discussed that subject fully. and we emerged with a plan which i will carry out with the help of charlie and lou. under this plan i intend to hire a younger man or woman with the potential to manage a very large portfolio who we hope will succeed me as berkshire's chief investment officer when the need for someone to do that arises. as part of the selection process we may in fact take on several candidates. picking the right persons will not be an easy task. it's not hard of course to find smart people among them individuals who have impressive investment records. but there is far more to successful long term investing than brains and performance that has recently been good. over time markets will do extraordinary even bizarre things. a single big mistake could wipe out a long string of successes. we therefore need someone genetically programmed to recognize and avoid serious risks including those never before encountered. certain perils that lurk in investment strategies cannot be spotted by use of the models commonly employed today by financial institutions. temperament is also important. independent thinking emotional stability and a keen understanding of both human and institutional behavior is vital to longterm investment success. i've seen a lot of very smart people who have lacked these virtues. finally we have a special problem to consider our ability to keep the person we hire. being able to list berkshire on a resume would materially enhance the marketability of an investment manager. we will need therefore to be sure we can retain our choice even though he or she could leave and make much more money elsewhere. ## there are surely people who fit what we need but they may be hard to identify. in #### jack byrne and i felt we had found such a person in lou simpson. we then made an arrangement with him whereby he would be paid well for sustained overperformance. under this deal he has earned large amounts. lou however could have left us long ago to manage far greater sums on more advantageous terms. if money alone had been the object that's exactly what he would have done. but lou never considered such a move. we need to find a younger person or two made of the same stuff. the good news at ## i feel terrific and according to all measurable indicators am in excellent health. it's amazing what cherry coke and hamburgers will do for a fellow. some changes on berkshire's board the composition of our board will change in two ways this spring. one change will involve the chace family which has been connected to berkshire and its predecessor companies for more than a century. in #### the first malcolm g. chace played an important role in merging four new england textile operations into berkshire fine spinning associates. that company merged with hathaway manufacturing in #### to form berkshire hathaway and malcolm g. chace jr. became its chairman. early in #### malcolm arranged for buffett partnership ltd. to buy a key block of berkshire shares and welcomed us as the new controlling shareholder of the company. malcolm continued as non executive chairman until ####. he was both a wonderful gentleman and helpful partner. that description also fits his son malcolm kim chace who succeeded his father on berkshire's board in ####. but last year kim now actively and successfully running a community bank that he founded in #### suggested that we find a younger person to replace him on our board. we have done so and kim will step down as a director at the annual meeting. i owe much to the chaces and wish to thank kim for his many years of service to berkshire. in selecting a new director we were guided by our longstanding criteria which are that board members be owneroriented businesssavvy interested and truly independent. i say truly because many directors who are now deemed independent by various authorities and observers are far from that relying heavily as they do on directors' fees to maintain their standard of living. these payments which come in many forms often range between ###### and ###### annually compensation that may approach or even exceed all other income of the independent director. and  surprise surprise  director compensation has soared in recent years pushed up by recommendations from corporate america's favorite consultant ratchet ratchet and bingo. the name may be phony but the action it conveys is not. charlie and i believe our four criteria are essential if directors are to do their job  which by law is to faithfully represent owners. yet these criteria are usually ignored. instead consultants and ceos seeking board candidates will often say we're looking for a woman or a hispanic or someone from abroad or what have you. it sometimes sounds as if the mission is to stock noah's ark. over the years i've been queried many times about potential directors and have yet to hear anyone ask does he think like an intelligent owner the questions i instead get would sound ridiculous to someone seeking candidates for say a football team or an arbitration panel or a military command. in those cases the selectors would look for people who had the specific talents and attitudes that were required for a specialized job. at berkshire we are in the specialized activity of running a business well and therefore we seek business judgment. that's exactly what we've found in susan decker cfo of yahoo who will join our board at the annual meeting. we are lucky to have her she scores very high on our four criteria and additionally at ## is young  an attribute as you may have noticed that your chairman has long lacked. we will seek more young directors in the future but never by slighting the four qualities that we insist upon. ## this and that berkshire will pay about #.# billion in federal income tax on its #### earnings. in its last fiscal year the u.s. government spent #.# trillion or about # billion per day. thus for more than half of one day berkshire picked up the tab for all federal expenditures ranging from social security and medicare payments to the cost of our armed services. had there been only ### taxpayers like berkshire no one else in america would have needed to pay any federal income or payroll taxes. our federal return last year we should add ran to #### pages. to handle this filing state and foreign tax returns a myriad of sec requirements and all of the other matters involved in running berkshire we have gone all the way up to ## employees at world headquarters. this crew occupies #### square feet of space and charlie  at world headquarters west in los angeles  uses another ### square feet. our homeoffice payroll including benefits and counting both locations totaled ####### last year. we're careful when spending your money. corporate bigwigs often complain about government spending criticizing bureaucrats who they say spend taxpayers' money differently from how they would if it were their own. but sometimes the financial behavior of executives will also vary based on whose wallet is getting depleted. here's an illustrative tale from my days at salomon. in the ####s the company had a barber jimmy by name who came in weekly to give free haircuts to the top brass. a manicurist was also on tap. then because of a costcutting drive patrons were told to pay their own way. one top executive not the ceo who had previously visited jimmy weekly went immediately to a onceeverythreeweeks schedule. every now and then charlie and i catch on early to a tide like trend one brimming over with commercial promise. for example though american airlines with its miles and american express with credit card points are credited as being trailblazers in granting customers rewards charlie and i were far ahead of them in spotting the appeal of this powerful idea. excited by our insight the two of us jumped into the reward business way back in #### by buying control of a trading stamp operation blue chip stamps. in that year blue chip had sales of ### million and its stamps papered california. in #### indeed about ## billion of our stamps were licked by savers pasted into books and taken to blue chip redemption stores. our catalog of rewards was # ## pages thick and chock full of tantalizing items. when i was told that even certain brothels and mortuaries gave stamps to their patrons i felt i had finally found a sure thing. well not quite. from the day charlie and i stepped into the blue chip picture the business went straight downhill. by #### sales had fallen to ##.# million. and by #### sales were bumping along at #.# million. no quitter i redoubled my managerial efforts. sales then fell another ##%. last year in berkshire's ## billion of revenues all of ##### no zeros omitted came from blue chip. ever hopeful charlie and i soldier on. i mentioned last year that in my service on ## corporate boards not counting berkshire or other controlled companies i have been the typhoid mary of compensation committees. at only one company was i assigned to comp committee duty and then i was promptly outvoted on the most crucial decision that we faced. my ostracism has been peculiar considering that i certainly haven't lacked experience in setting ceo pay. at berkshire after all i am a oneman compensation committee who determines the salaries and incentives for the ceos of around ## significant operating businesses. ## how much time does this aspect of my job take virtually none. how many ceos have voluntarily left us for other jobs in our ##year history precisely none. berkshire employs many different incentive arrangements with their terms depending on such elements as the economic potential or capital intensity of a ceo's business. whatever the compensation arrangement though i try to keep it both simple and fair. when we use incentives  and these can be large  they are always tied to the operating results for which a given ceo has authority. we issue no lottery tickets that carry payoffs unrelated to business performance. if a ceo bats .### he gets paid for being a .### hitter even if circumstances outside of his control cause berkshire to perform poorly. and if he bats .### he doesn't get a payoff just because the successes of others have enabled berkshire to prosper mightily. an example we now own ## billion of equities at berkshire whose value can easily rise or fall by ##% in a given year. why in the world should the pay of our operating executives be affected by such # billion swings however important the gain or loss may be for shareholders you've read loads about ceos who have received astronomical compensation for mediocre results. much less welladvertised is the fact that america's ceos also generally live the good life. many it should be emphasized are exceptionally able and almost all work far more than ## hours a week. but they are usually treated like royalty in the process. and we're certainly going to keep it that way at berkshire. though charlie still favors sackcloth and ashes i prefer to be spoiled rotten. berkshire owns the pampered chef our wonderful office group has made me the pampered chief. ceo perks at one company are quickly copied elsewhere. all the other kids have one may seem a thought too juvenile to use as a rationale in the boardroom. but consultants employ precisely this argument phrased more elegantly of course when they make recommendations to comp committees. irrational and excessive comp practices will not be materially changed by disclosure or by independent comp committee members. indeed i think it's likely that the reason i was rejected for service on so many comp committees was that i was regarded as too independent. compensation reform will only occur if the largest institutional shareholders  it would only take a few  demand afresh look at the whole system. the consultants' present drill of deftly selecting peer companies to compare with their clients will only perpetuate present excesses. last year i arranged for the bulk of my berkshire holdings to go to five charitable foundations thus carrying out part of my lifelong plan to eventually use all of my shares for philanthropic purposes. details of the commitments i made as well as the rationale for them are posted on our website www.berkshirehathaway.com . taxes i should note had nothing to do with my decision or its timing. my federal and state income taxes in #### were exactly what they would have been had i not made my first contributions last summer and the same point will apply to my #### contributions. in my will i've stipulated that the proceeds from all berkshire shares i still own at death are to be used for philanthropic purposes within ten years after my estate is closed. because my affairs are not complicated it should take three years at most for this closing to occur. adding this ##year period to my expected lifespan of about ## years though naturally i'm aiming for more means that proceeds from all of my berkshire shares will likely be distributed for societal purposes over the next ## years or so. i've set this schedule because i want the money to be spent relatively promptly by people i know to be capable vigorous and motivated. these managerial attributes sometimes wane as institutions  particularly those that are exempt from market forces  age. today there are terrific people in charge at the five foundations. so at my death why should they not move with dispatch to judiciously spend the money that remains ## those people favoring perpetual foundations argue that in the future there will most certainly be large and important societal problems that philanthropy will need to address. i agree. but there will then also be many superrich individuals and families whose wealth will exceed that of today's americans and to whom philanthropic organizations can make their case for funding. these funders can then judge firsthand which operations have both the vitality and the focus to best address the major societal problems that then exist. in this way a market test of ideas and effectiveness can be applied. some organizations will deserve major support while others will have outlived their usefulness. even if the people above ground make their decisions imperfectly they should be able to allocate funds more rationally than a decedent six feet under will have ordained decades earlier. wills of course can always be rewritten but it's very unlikely that my thinking will change in a material way. a few shareholders have expressed concern that sales of berkshire by the foundations receiving shares will depress the stock. these fears are unwarranted. the annual trading volume of many stocks exceeds ###% of the outstanding shares but nevertheless these stocks usually sell at prices approximating their intrinsic value. berkshire also tends to sell at an appropriate price but with annual volume that is only ##% of shares outstanding. at most sales by the foundations receiving my shares will add three percentage points to annual trading volume which will still leave berkshire with a turnover ratio that is the lowest around. overall berkshire's business performance will determine the price of our stock and most of the time it will sell in a zone of reasonableness. it's important that the foundations receive appropriate prices as they periodically sell berkshire shares but it's also important that incoming shareholders don't overpay. see economic principle ## on page ##. by both our policies and shareholder communications charlie and i will do our best to ensure that berkshire sells at neither a large discount nor large premium to intrinsic value. the existence of foundation ownership will in no way influence our board's decisions about dividends repurchases or the issuance of shares. we will follow exactly the same rule that has guided us in the past what action will be likely to deliver the best result for shareholders over time in last year's report i allegorically described the gotrocks family  a clan that owned all of america's businesses and that counterproductively attempted to increase its investment returns by paying evergreater commissions and fees to helpers. sad to say the family continued its selfdestructive ways in ####. in part the family persists in this folly because it harbors unrealistic expectations about obtainable returns. sometimes these delusions are selfserving. for example private pension plans can temporarily overstate their earnings and public pension plans can defer the need for increased taxes by using investment assumptions that are likely to be out of reach. actuaries and auditors go along with these tactics and it can be decades before the chickens come home to roost at which point the ceo or public official who misled the world is apt to be gone. meanwhile wall street's pied pipers of performance will have encouraged the futile hopes of the family. the hapless gotrocks will be assured that they all can achieve aboveaverage investment performance  but only by paying everhigher fees. call this promise the adult version of lake woebegon. in #### promises and fees hit new highs. a flood of money went from institutional investors to the #and## crowd. for those innocent of this arrangement let me explain it's a lopsided system whereby #% of your principal is paid each year to the manager even if he accomplishes nothing  or for that matter loses you a bundle  and additionally ##% of your profit is paid to him if he succeeds even if his success is due simply to a rising tide. for example a manager who achieves a gross return of ##% in a year will keep #.# percentage points  two points off the top plus ##% of the residual # points  leaving only #.# percentage points for his investors. on a # billion fund this #.#% net performance will deliver the manager a cool ### million. he will receive this bonanza even though an index fund might have returned ##% to investors in the same period and charged them only a token fee. ## the inexorable math of this grotesque arrangement is certain to make the gotrocks family poorer over time than it would have been had it never heard of these hyperhelpers. even so the #and## action spreads. its effects bring to mind the old adage when someone with experience proposes a deal to someone with money too often the fellow with money ends up with the experience and the fellow with experience ends up with the money. let me end this section by telling you about one of the good guys of wall street my longtime friend walter schloss who last year turned ##. from #### to #### walter managed a remarkably successful investment partnership from which he took not a dime unless his investors made money. my admiration for walter it should be noted is not based on hindsight. a full fifty years ago walter was my sole recommendation to a st. louis family who wanted an honest and able investment manager. walter did not go to business school or for that matter college. his office contained one file cabinet in #### the number mushroomed to four by ####. walter worked without a secretary clerk or bookkeeper his only associate being his son edwin a graduate of the north carolina school of the arts. walter and edwin never came within a mile of inside information. indeed they used outside information only sparingly generally selecting securities by certain simple statistical methods walter learned while working for ben graham. when walter and edwin were asked in #### by outstanding investors digest how would you summarize your approach edwin replied we try to buy stocks cheap. so much for modern portfolio theory technical analysis macroeconomic thoughts and complex algorithms. following a strategy that involved no real risk  defined as permanent loss of capital  walter produced results over his ## partnership years that dramatically surpassed those of the sp ###. it's particularly noteworthy that he built this record by investing in about #### securities mostly of a lackluster type. a few big winners did not account for his success. it's safe to say that had millions of investment managers made trades by a drawing stock names from a hat b purchasing these stocks in comparable amounts when walter made a purchase and then c selling when walter sold his pick the luckiest of them would not have come close to equaling his record. there is simply no possibility that what walter achieved over ## years was due to chance. i first publicly discussed walter's remarkable record in ####. at that time efficient market theory emt was the centerpiece of investment instruction at most major business schools. this theory as then most commonly taught held that the price of any stock at any moment is not demonstrably mispriced which means that no investor can be expected to overperform the stock market averages using only publiclyavailable information though some will do so by luck. when i talked about walter ## years ago his record forcefully contradicted this dogma. and what did members of the academic community do when they were exposed to this new and important evidence unfortunately they reacted in alltoohuman fashion rather than opening their minds they closed their eyes. to my knowledge no business school teaching emt made any attempt to study walter's performance and what it meant for the school's cherished theory. instead the faculties of the schools went merrily on their way presenting emt as having the certainty of scripture. typically a finance instructor who had the nerve to question emt had about as much chance of major promotion as galileo had of being named pope. tens of thousands of students were therefore sent out into life believing that on every day the price of every stock was right or more accurately not demonstrably wrong and that attempts to evaluate businesses  that is stocks  were useless. walter meanwhile went on overperforming his job made easier by the misguided instructions that had been given to those young minds. after all if you are in the shipping business it's helpful to have all of your potential competitors be taught that the earth is flat. maybe it was a good thing for his investors that walter didn't go to college. ## the annual meeting our meeting this year will be held on saturday may # th . as always the doors will open at the qwest center at # a.m. and a new berkshire movie will be shown at ###. at ### we will go directly to the questionandanswer period which with a break for lunch at the qwest' s stands will last until ###. then after a short recess charlie and i will convene the annual meeting at ###. if you decide to leave during the day's question periods please do so while charlie is talking. the best reason to exit of course is to shop. we will help you do that by filling the ###### square foot hall that adjoins the meeting area with the products of berkshire subsidiaries. last year the ##### people who came to the meeting did their part and almost every location racked up record sales. but records are made to be broken and i know you can do better. this year we will again showcase a clayton home featuring acme brick shaw carpet johns manville insulation mitek fasteners carefree awnings and nfm furniture. you will find that the home priced at ###### delivers excellent value. last year a helper at the qwest bought one of two homes on display well before we opened the doors to shareholders. flanking the clayton home on the exhibition floor this year will be an rv and pontoon boat from forest river. geico will have a booth staffed by a number of its top counselors from around the country all of them ready to supply you with auto insurance quotes. in most cases geico will be able to give you a special shareholder discount usually #%. this special offer is permitted by ## of the ## jurisdictions in which we operate. one supplemental point the discount is not additive if you qualify for another such as that given certain groups. bring the details of your existing insurance and check out whether we can save you money. for at least ##% of you i believe we can. and while you're at it sign up for the new geico credit card. it's the one i now use sparingly of course. on saturday at the omaha airport we will have the usual array of aircraft from netjets available for your inspection. stop by the netjets booth at the qwest to learn about viewing these planes. come to omaha by bus leave in your new plane. and take all the hair gel that you wish on board with you. in the bookworm's corner of our bazaar there will be about ## books and dvds  all discounted  led again by poor charlie's almanack. one hapless soul last year asked charlie what he should do if he didn't enjoy the book. back came a mungerism no problem  just give it to someone more intelligent. we've added a few titles this year. among them are seeking wisdom from darwin to munger by peter bevelin a longtime swedish shareholder of berkshire and fred schwed's classic where are the customers' yachts this book was first published in #### and is now in its # th edition. the funniest book ever written about investing it lightly delivers many truly important messages on the subject. an attachment to the proxy material that is enclosed with this report explains how you can obtain the credential you will need for admission to the meeting and other events. as for plane hotel and car reservations we have again signed up american express ########## to give you special help. carol pedersen who handles these matters does a terrific job for us each year and i thank her for it. hotel rooms can be hard to find but work with carol and you will get one. at nebraska furniture mart located on a ##acre site on ## nd street between dodge and pacific we will again be having berkshire weekend discount pricing. we initiated this special event at nfm ten years ago and sales during the weekend grew from #.# million in #### to ## million in ####. i get goose bumps just thinking about this volume. to obtain the berkshire discount you must make your purchases between thursday may # ld and monday may # th inclusive and also present your meeting credential. the period's special pricing will even apply to the products of several prestigious manufacturers that normally have ironclad rules against discounting but which in the spirit of our shareholder weekend have made an exception for you. we appreciate their cooperation. nfm is open from ## a.m. to # p.m. monday through saturday and ## a.m. ## to # p.m. on sunday. on saturday this year from ### p.m. to # p.m. nfm is having a special shareholder picnic featuring chicken and beef tacos and hamburgers for traditionalists like me. at a remodeled and expanded borsheim's we will again have two shareholderonly events. the first will be a cocktail reception from # p.m. to ## p.m. on friday may # th . the second the main gala will be held on sunday may # th  from # a.m. to # p.m. on saturday we will be open until # p.m. we will have huge crowds at borsheim's throughout the weekend. for your convenience therefore shareholder prices will be available from monday april ## th through saturday may ## th . during that period please identify yourself as a shareholder by presenting your meeting credentials or a brokerage statement that shows you are a berkshire holder. on sunday in a tent outside of borsheim's a blindfolded patrick wolff twice u.s. chess champion will take on all comers  who will have their eyes wide open  in groups of six. last year i carried on a conversation with patrick while he played in this manner. nearby norman beck a remarkable magician from dallas will bewilder onlookers. additionally we will have bob hamman and sharon osberg two of the world's top bridge experts available to play bridge with our shareholders on sunday afternoon. to add to the sunday fun at borsheim's ariel hsing will play table tennis pingpong to the uninitiated from # p.m. to # p.m. against anyone brave enough to take her on. ariel though only ## is ranked number one among girls under ## in the u.s. and number # among both boys and girls under ##. the week i turned ## i played ariel then # and barely tall enough to see across the table thinking i would take it easy on her so as not to crush her young spirit. instead she crushed me. i've since devised a plan that will give me a chance against her. at # p.m. on sunday i will initiate play with a #point game against ariel. if i somehow win the first point i will then feign injury and claim victory. after this strenuous encounter wears ariel down our shareholders can then try their luck against her. gorat's will again be open exclusively for berkshire shareholders on sunday may # th  and will be serving from # p.m. until ## p.m. please remember that to come to gorat's on that day you must have a reservation. to make one call ########## on april # st but not before. in the ######## school year ## university classes including one from ibmec in brazil will come to omaha for sessions with me. i take almost all  in aggregate more than #### students  to lunch at gorat's. and they love it. to learn why come join us on sunday. we will again have a reception at # p.m. on saturday afternoon for shareholders who have come from outside of north america. every year our meeting draws many people from around the globe and charlie and i want to be sure we personally greet those who have come so far. last year we enjoyed meeting more than ### of you from many dozens of countries. any shareholder who comes from other than the u.s. or canada will be given a special credential and instructions for attending this function. charlie and i are extraordinarily lucky. we were born in america had terrific parents who saw that we got good educations have enjoyed wonderful families and great health and came equipped with a business gene that allows us to prosper in a manner hugely disproportionate to other people who contribute as much or more to our society's wellbeing. moreover we have long had jobs that we love in which we are helped every day in countless ways by talented and cheerful associates. no wonder we tap dance to work. but nothing is more fun for us than getting together with our shareholderpartners at berkshire's annual meeting. so join us on may # th at the qwest for our annual woodstock for capitalists. we'll see you there. february ## #### warren e. buffett chairman of the board ## berkshire's corporate performance vs. the sp

#### accounting rules required insurance companies to value the equity securities they hold at market rather than at the lower of cost or market which was previously the requirement. in this table berkshire's results through #### have been restated to conform to the changed rules. in all other respects the results are calculated using the numbers originally reported. the sp ### numbers are pretax whereas the berkshire numbers are aftertax. if a corporation such as berkshire were simply to have owned the sp ### and accrued the appropriate taxes its results would have lagged the sp ### in years when that index showed a positive return but would have exceeded the sp ### in years when the index showed a negative return. over the years the tax costs would have caused the aggregate lag to be substantial. # berkshire hathaway inc. to the shareholders of berkshire hathaway inc. our gain in net worth during #### was ##.# billion which increased the pershare book value of both our class a and class b stock by ##.#%. over the last ## years that is since present management took over book value has grown from ## to ##### a rate of ##.#% compounded annually. berkshire's recent acquisition of burlington northern santa fe bnsf has added at least ##### shareholders to the ###### or so already on our books. it's important to charlie munger my longtime partner and me that all of our owners understand berkshire's operations goals limitations and culture. in each annual report consequently we restate the economic principles that guide us. this year these principles appear on pages #### and i urge all of you  but particularly our new shareholders  to read them. berkshire has adhered to these principles for decades and will continue to do so long after i'm gone. in this letter we will also review some of the basics of our business hoping to provide both a freshman orientation session for our bnsf newcomers and a refresher course for berkshire veterans. how we measure ourselves our metrics for evaluating our managerial performance are displayed on the facing page. from the start charlie and i have believed in having a rational and unbending standard for measuring what we have  or have not  accomplished. that keeps us from the temptation of seeing where the arrow of performance lands and then painting the bull's eye around it. selecting the sp ### as our bogey was an easy choice because our shareholders at virtually no cost can match its performance by holding an index fund. why should they pay us for merely duplicating that result a more difficult decision for us was how to measure the progress of berkshire versus the sp. there are good arguments for simply using the change in our stock price. over an extended period of time in fact that is the best test. but yeartoyear market prices can be extraordinarily erratic. even evaluations covering as long as a decade can be greatly distorted by foolishly high or low prices at the beginning or end of the measurement period. steve ballmer of microsoft and jeff immelt of ge can tell you about that problem suffering as they do from the nosebleed prices at which their stocks traded when they were handed the managerial baton. the ideal standard for measuring our yearly progress would be the change in berkshire's pershare intrinsic value. alas that value cannot be calculated with anything close to precision so we instead use a crude proxy for it pershare book value. relying on this yardstick has its shortcomings which we discuss on pages ## and ##. additionally book value at most companies understates intrinsic value and that is certainly the case at berkshire. in aggregate our businesses are worth considerably more than the values at which they are carried on our books. in our allimportant insurance business moreover the difference is huge. even so charlie and i believe that our book value  understated though it is  supplies the most useful tracking device for changes in intrinsic value. by this measurement as the opening paragraph of this letter states our book value since the start of fiscal #### has grown at a rate of ##.#% compounded annually. a## pershare figures used in this report apply to berkshire's a shares. figures for the b shares are ## ### th of those shown for a. # we should note that had we instead chosen market prices as our yardstick berkshire's results would look better showing a gain since the start of fiscal #### of ##% compounded annually. surprisingly this modest difference in annual compounding rate leads to an ######% marketvalue gain for the entire ##year period compared to the bookvalue gain of ######% shown on page #. our market gain is better because in #### berkshire shares sold at an appropriate discount to the book value of its underearning textile assets whereas today berkshire shares regularly sell at a premium to the accounting values of its firstclass businesses. summed up the table on page # conveys three messages two positive and one hugely negative. first we have never had any fiveyear period beginning with ###### and ending with ######  and there have been ## of these  during which our gain in book value did not exceed the sp's gain. second though we have lagged the sp in some years that were positive for the market we have consistently done better than the sp in the eleven years during which it delivered negative results. in other words our defense has been better than our offense and that's likely to continue. the big minus is that our performance advantage has shrunk dramatically as our size has grown an unpleasant trend that is certain to continue. to be sure berkshire has many outstanding businesses and a cadre of truly great managers operating within an unusual corporate culture that lets them maximize their talents. charlie and i believe these factors will continue to produce betterthanaverage results over time. but huge sums forge their own anchor and our future advantage if any will be a small fraction of our historical edge. what we don't do long ago charlie laid out his strongest ambition all i want to know is where i'm going to die so i'll never go there. that bit of wisdom was inspired by jacobi the great prussian mathematician who counseled invert always invert as an aid to solving difficult problems. i can report as well that this inversion approach works on a less lofty level sing a country song in reverse and you will quickly recover your car house and wife. here are a few examples of how we apply charlie's thinking at berkshire  charlie and i avoid businesses whose futures we can't evaluate no matter how exciting their products may be. in the past it required no brilliance for people to foresee the fabulous growth that awaited such industries as autos in #### aircraft in #### and television sets in ####. but the future then also included competitive dynamics that would decimate almost all of the companies entering those industries. even the survivors tended to come away bleeding. just because charlie and i can clearly see dramatic growth ahead for an industry does not mean we can judge what its profit margins and returns on capital will be as a host of competitors battle for supremacy. at berkshire we will stick with businesses whose profit picture for decades to come seems reasonably predictable. even then we will make plenty of mistakes.  we will never become dependent on the kindness of strangers. toobigtofail is not a fallback position at berkshire. instead we will always arrange our affairs so that any requirements for cash we may conceivably have will be dwarfed by our own liquidity. moreover that liquidity will be constantly refreshed by a gusher of earnings from our many and diverse businesses. when the financial system went into cardiac arrest in september #### berkshire was a supplier of liquidity and capital to the system not a supplicant. at the very peak of the crisis we poured ##.# billion into a business world that could otherwise look only to the federal government for help. of that # billion went to bolster capital at three highlyregarded and previouslysecure american businesses that needed  without delay  our tangible vote of confidence. the remaining #.# billion satisfied our commitment to help fund the purchase of wrigley a deal that was completed without pause while elsewhere panic reigned. # we pay a steep price to maintain our premier financial strength. the ## billionplus of cash equivalent assets that we customarily hold is earning a pittance at present. but we sleep well.  we tend to let our many subsidiaries operate on their own without our supervising and monitoring them to any degree. that means we are sometimes late in spotting management problems and that both operating and capital decisions are occasionally made with which charlie and i would have disagreed had we been consulted. most of our managers however use the independence we grant them magnificently rewarding our confidence by maintaining an owner oriented attitude that is invaluable and too seldom found in huge organizations. we would rather suffer the visible costs of a few bad decisions than incur the many invisible costs that come from decisions made too slowly  or not at all  because of a stifling bureaucracy. with our acquisition of bnsf we now have about ###### employees and literally hundreds of different operating units. we hope to have many more of each. but we will never allow berkshire to become some monolith that is overrun with committees budget presentations and multiple layers of management. instead we plan to operate as a collection of separatelymanaged medium sized and large businesses most of whose decisionmaking occurs at the operating level. charlie and i will limit ourselves to allocating capital controlling enterprise risk choosing managers and setting their compensation.  we make no attempt to woo wall street. investors who buy and sell based upon media or analyst commentary are not for us. instead we want partners who join us at berkshire because they wish to make a longterm investment in a business they themselves understand and because it's one that follows policies with which they concur. if charlie and i were to go into a small venture with a few partners we would seek individuals in sync with us knowing that common goals and a shared destiny make for a happy business marriage between owners and managers. scaling up to giant size doesn't change that truth. to build a compatible shareholder population we try to communicate with our owners directly and informatively. our goal is to tell you what we would like to know if our positions were reversed. additionally we try to post our quarterly and annual financial information on the internet early on weekends thereby giving you and other investors plenty of time during a nontrading period to digest just what has happened at our multifaceted enterprise. occasionally sec deadlines force a nonfriday disclosure. these matters simply can't be adequately summarized in a few paragraphs nor do they lend themselves to the kind of catchy headline that journalists sometimes seek. last year we saw in one instance how soundbite reporting can go wrong. among the ##### words in the annual letter was this sentence we are certain for example that the economy will be in shambles throughout ####  and probably well beyond  but that conclusion does not tell us whether the market will rise or fall. many news organizations reported  indeed blared  the first part of the sentence while making no mention whatsoever of its ending. i regard this as terrible journalism misinformed readers or viewers may well have thought that charlie and i were forecasting bad things for the stock market though we had not only in that sentence but also elsewhere made it clear we weren't predicting the market at all. any investors who were misled by the sensationalists paid a big price the dow closed the day of the letter at #### and finished the year at #####. given a few experiences we've had like that you can understand why i prefer that our communications with you remain as direct and unabridged as possible. let's move to the specifics of berkshire's operations. we have four major operating sectors each differing from the others in balance sheet and income account characteristics. therefore lumping them together as is standard in financial statements impedes analysis. so we'll present them as four separate businesses which is how charlie and i view them. # insurance our propertycasualty pc insurance business has been the engine behind berkshire's growth and will continue to be. it has worked wonders for us. we carry our pc companies on our books at ##.# billion more than their net tangible assets an amount lodged in our goodwill account. these companies however are worth far more than their carrying value  and the following look at the economic model of the pc industry will tell you why. insurers receive premiums upfront and pay claims later. in extreme cases such as those arising from certain workers' compensation accidents payments can stretch over decades. this collectnow paylater model leaves us holding large sums  money we call float  that will eventually go to others. meanwhile we get to invest this float for berkshire's benefit. though individual policies and claims come and go the amount of float we hold remains remarkably stable in relation to premium volume. consequently as our business grows so does our float. if premiums exceed the total of expenses and eventual losses we register an underwriting profit that adds to the investment income produced from the float. this combination allows us to enjoy the use of free money  and better yet get paid for holding it. alas the hope of this happy result attracts intense competition so vigorous in most years as to cause the pc industry as a whole to operate at a significant underwriting loss. this loss in effect is what the industry pays to hold its float. usually this cost is fairly low but in some catastropheridden years the cost from underwriting losses more than eats up the income derived from use of float. in my perhaps biased view berkshire has the best large insurance operation in the world. and i will absolutely state that we have the best managers. our float has grown from ## million in #### when we entered the business to ## billion at the end of ####. moreover we have now operated at an underwriting profit for seven consecutive years. i believe it likely that we will continue to underwrite profitably in most  though certainly not all  future years. if we do so our float will be costfree much as if someone deposited ## billion with us that we could invest for our own benefit without the payment of interest. let me emphasize again that costfree float is not a result to be expected for the pc industry as a whole in most years premiums have been inadequate to cover claims plus expenses. consequently the industry's overall return on tangible equity has for many decades fallen far short of that achieved by the sp ###. outstanding economics exist at berkshire only because we have some outstanding managers running some unusual businesses. our insurance ceos deserve your thanks having added many billions of dollars to berkshire's value. it's a pleasure for me to tell you about these allstars. let's start at geico which is known to all of you because of its ### million annual advertising budget close to twice that of the runnerup advertiser in the auto insurance field. geico is managed by tony nicely who joined the company at ##. now ## tony still tapdances to the office every day just as i do at ##. we both feel lucky to work at a business we love. geico' s customers have warm feelings toward the company as well. here's proof since berkshire acquired control of geico in #### its market share has increased from #.#% to #.#% a gain reflecting the net addition of seven million policyholders. perhaps they contacted us because they thought our gecko was cute but they bought from us to save important money. maybe you can as well call ########### or go to www.geico.com. and they've stayed with us because they like our service as well as our price. berkshire acquired geico in two stages. in ###### we bought about onethird of the company's stock for ## million. over the years large repurchases by the company of its own shares caused our position to grow to about ##% without our having bought any more shares. then on january # #### we acquired the remaining ##% of geico for #.# billion in cash about ## times the cost of our original purchase. # an old wall street joke gets close to our experience customer thanks for putting me in xyz stock at #. # hear it's up to ##. broker yes and that's just the beginning. in fact the company is doing so well now that it's an even better buy at ## than it was when you made your purchase. customer damn i knew i should have waited. geico's growth may slow in ####. u.s. vehicle registrations are actually down because of slumping auto sales. moreover high unemployment is causing a growing number of drivers to go uninsured. that's illegal almost everywhere but if you've lost your job and still want to drive . . . our lowcost producer status however is sure to give us significant gains in the future. in #### geico was the country's sixth largest auto insurer now we are number three. the company's float has grown from #.# billion to #.# billion. equally important geico has operated at an underwriting profit in ## of the ## years berkshire has owned it. i became excited about geico in january #### when i first visited the company as a ##yearold student. thanks to tony i'm even more excited today. a hugely important event in berkshire's history occurred on a saturday in ####. ajit jain came into our office in omaha  and i immediately knew we had found a superstar. he had been discovered by mike goldberg now elevated to st. mike. we immediately put ajit in charge of national indemnity's small and struggling reinsurance operation. over the years he has built this business into a oneofakind giant in the insurance world. staffed today by only ## people ajit's operation has set records for transaction size in several areas of insurance. ajit writes billiondollar limits  and then keeps every dime of the risk instead of laying it off with other insurers. three years ago he took over huge liabilities from lloyds allowing it to clean up its relationship with ##### participants names who had written problemridden policies that at one point threatened the survival of this ###yearold institution. the premium for that single contract was #.# billion. during #### he negotiated a life reinsurance contract that could produce ## billion of premium for us over the next ## or so years. ajit's business is just the opposite of geico's. at that company we have millions of small policies that largely renew year after year. ajit writes relatively few policies and the mix changes significantly from year to year. throughout the world he is known as the man to call when something both very large and unusual needs to be insured. if charlie i and ajit are ever in a sinking boat  and you can only save one of us  swim to ajit. our third insurance powerhouse is general re. some years back this operation was troubled now it is a gleaming jewel in our insurance crown. under the leadership of tad montross general re had an outstanding underwriting year in #### while also delivering us unusually large amounts of float per dollar of premium volume. alongside general re's pc business tad and his associates have developed a major life reinsurance operation that has grown increasingly valuable. last year general re finally attained ###% ownership of cologne re which since #### has been a key  though only partiallyowned  part of our presence around the world. tad and i will be visiting cologne in september to thank its managers for their important contribution to berkshire. # finally we own a group of smaller companies most of them specializing in odd corners of the insurance world. in aggregate their results have consistently been profitable and as the table below shows the float they provide us is substantial. charlie and i treasure these companies and their managers. here is the record of all four segments of our propertycasualty and life insurance businesses underwriting profit yearend float in millions insurance operations #### #### #### #### general re  ###  ### ##### ##### bh reinsurance ### #### ##### ##### geico ### ### #### #### other primary ## ### #### #### #### #### ##### ##### and now a painful confession last year your chairman closed the book on a very expensive business fiasco entirely of his own making. for many years i had struggled to think of side products that we could offer our millions of loyal geico customers. unfortunately i finally succeeded coming up with a brilliant insight that we should market our own credit card. i reasoned that geico policyholders were likely to be good credit risks and assuming we offered an attractive card would likely favor us with their business. we got business all right  but of the wrong type. our pretax losses from creditcard operations came to about #.# million before i finally woke up. we then sold our ## million portfolio of troubled receivables for ### on the dollar losing an additional ## million. geico' s managers it should be emphasized were never enthusiastic about my idea. they warned me that instead of getting the cream of geico' s customers we would get the well let's call it the noncream. i subtly indicated that i was older and wiser. i was just older. regulated utility business berkshire has an ##.#% interest in midamerican energy holdings which owns a wide variety of utility operations. the largest of these are # yorkshire electricity and northern electric whose #.# million end users make it the u.k.'s third largest distributor of electricity # midamerican energy which serves ###### electric customers primarily in iowa # pacific power and rocky mountain power serving about #.# million electric customers in six western states and # kern river and northern natural pipelines which carry about #% of the natural gas consumed in the u.s. midamerican has two terrific managers dave sokol and greg abel. in addition my longtime friend walter scott along with his family has a major ownership position in the company. walter brings extraordinary business savvy to any operation. ten years of working with dave greg and walter have reinforced my original belief berkshire couldn't have better partners. they are truly a dream team. somewhat incongruously midamerican also owns the second largest real estate brokerage firm in the u.s. homeservices of america. this company operates through ## locallybranded firms that have ##### agents. though last year was again a terrible year for home sales homeservices earned a modest sum. it also acquired a firm in chicago and will add other quality brokerage operations when they are available at sensible prices. a decade from now homeservices is likely to be much larger. # here are some key figures on midamerican' s operations earnings  in

net of related income taxes of ## in #### and ## in ####. our regulated electric utilities offering monopoly service in most cases operate in a symbiotic manner with the customers in their service areas with those users depending on us to provide firstclass service and invest for their future needs. permitting and construction periods for generation and major transmission facilities stretch way out so it is incumbent on us to be farsighted. we in turn look to our utilities' regulators acting on behalf of our customers to allow us an appropriate return on the huge amounts of capital we must deploy to meet future needs. we shouldn't expect our regulators to live up to their end of the bargain unless we live up to ours. dave and greg make sure we do just that. national research companies consistently rank our iowa and western utilities at or near the top of their industry. similarly among the ## u.s. pipelines ranked by a firm named mastio our kern river and northern natural properties tied for second place. moreover we continue to pour huge sums of money into our operations so as to not only prepare for the future but also make these operations more environmentally friendly. since we purchased midamerican ten years ago it has never paid a dividend. we have instead used earnings to improve and expand our properties in each of the territories we serve. as one dramatic example in the last three years our iowa and western utilities have earned #.# billion while in this same period spending # billion on wind generation facilities. midamerican has consistently kept its end of the bargain with society and to society's credit it has reciprocated with few exceptions our regulators have promptly allowed us to earn a fair return on the ever increasing sums of capital we must invest. going forward we will do whatever it takes to serve our territories in the manner they expect. we believe that in turn we will be allowed the return we deserve on the funds we invest. in earlier days charlie and i shunned capitalintensive businesses such as public utilities. indeed the best businesses by far for owners continue to be those that have high returns on capital and that require little incremental investment to grow. we are fortunate to own a number of such businesses and we would love to buy more. anticipating however that berkshire will generate everincreasing amounts of cash we are today quite willing to enter businesses that regularly require large capital expenditures. we expect only that these businesses have reasonable expectations of earning decent returns on the incremental sums they invest. if our expectations are met  and we believe that they will be  berkshire's evergrowing collection of good to great businesses should produce aboveaverage though certainly not spectacular returns in the decades ahead. # our bnsf operation it should be noted has certain important economic characteristics that resemble those of our electric utilities. in both cases we provide fundamental services that are and will remain essential to the economic wellbeing of our customers the communities we serve and indeed the nation. both will require heavy investment that greatly exceeds depreciation allowances for decades to come. both must also plan far ahead to satisfy demand that is expected to outstrip the needs of the past. finally both require wise regulators who will provide certainty about allowable returns so that we can confidently make the huge investments required to maintain replace and expand the plant. we see a social compact existing between the public and our railroad business just as is the case with our utilities. if either side shirks its obligations both sides will inevitably suffer. therefore both parties to the compact should  and we believe will  understand the benefit of behaving in a way that encourages good behavior by the other. it is inconceivable that our country will realize anything close to its full economic potential without its possessing firstclass electricity and railroad systems. we will do our part to see that they exist. in the future bnsf results will be included in this regulated utility section. aside from the two businesses having similar underlying economic characteristics both are logical users of substantial amounts of debt that is not guaranteed by berkshire. both will retain most of their earnings. both will earn and invest large sums in good times or bad though the railroad will display the greater cyclically. overall we expect this regulated sector to deliver significantly increased earnings over time albeit at the cost of our investing many tens  yes tens  of billions of dollars of incremental equity capital. manufacturing service and retailing operations our activities in this part of berkshire cover the waterfront. let's look though at a summary balance sheet and earnings statement for the entire group. balance sheet assets cash and equivalents  #### accounts and notes receivable #### inventory #### other current assets ### total current assets ##### goodwill and other intangibles # #### fixed assets ##### other assets #### ##### in millions liabilities and equity notes payable  #### other current liabilities #### total current liabilities #### deferred taxes #### term debt and other liabilities #### equity ##### ##### earnings statement  in millions  #### #### #### revenues ##### ##### ##### operating expenses including depreciation of #### in #### #### in #### and ### in #### ##### ##### ##### interest expense ## ### ### pretax earnings #### #### #### income taxes and minority interests ### #### #### net income  ####  ####  #### does not include purchaseaccounting adjustments. ## almost all of the many and widelydiverse operations in this sector suffered to one degree or another from ####' s severe recession. the major exception was mclane our distributor of groceries confections and nonfood items to thousands of retail outlets the largest by far walmart. grady rosier led mclane to record pretax earnings of ### million which even so amounted to only slightly more than one cent per dollar on its huge sales of ##.# billion. mclane employs a vast array of physical assets  practically all of which it owns  including #### trailers #### tractors and ## distribution centers with ##.# million square feet of space. mclane' s prime asset however is grady. we had a number of companies at which profits improved even as sales contracted always an exceptional managerial achievement. here are the ceos who made it happen among the businesses we own that have major exposure to the depressed industrial sector both marmon and iscar turned in relatively strong performances. frank ptak's marmon delivered a ##.#% pretax profit margin a record high. though the company's sales were down ##% frank's costconscious management mitigated the decline in earnings. nothing stops israelbased iscar  not wars recessions or competitors. the world's two other leading suppliers of small cutting tools both had very difficult years each operating at a loss throughout much of the year. though iscar' s results were down significantly from #### the company regularly reported profits even while it was integrating and rationalizing tungaloy the large japanese acquisition that we told you about last year. when manufacturing rebounds iscar will set new records. its incredible managerial team of eitan wertheimer jacob harpaz and danny goldman will see to that. every business we own that is connected to residential and commercial construction suffered severely in ####. combined pretax earnings of shaw johns manville acme brick and mitek were ### million an ##.#% decline from #### billion in #### when construction activity was booming. these businesses continue to bump along the bottom though their competitive positions remain undented. the major problem for berkshire last year was netjets an aviation operation that offers fractional ownership of jets. over the years it has been enormously successful in establishing itself as the premier company in its industry with the value of its fleet far exceeding that of its three major competitors combined. overall our dominance in the field remains unchallenged. netjets' business operation however has been another story. in the eleven years that we have owned the company it has recorded an aggregate pretax loss of ### million. moreover the company's debt has soared from ### million at the time of purchase to #.# billion in april of last year. without berkshire's guarantee of this debt netjets would have been out of business. it's clear that i failed you in letting netjets descend into this condition. but luckily i have been bailed out. company ceo benjamin moore paint borsheims jewelry retailing h. h. brown manufacturing and retailing of shoes ctb agricultural equipment dairy queen nebraska furniture mart furniture retailing pampered chef direct sales of kitchen tools see's manufacturing and retailing of candy star furniture furniture retailing denis abrams susan jacques jim issler vic mancinelli john gainor ron and irv blumkin maria gottschalk brad kinstler bill kimbrell ## dave sokol the enormously talented builder and operator of midamerican energy became ceo of netjets in august. his leadership has been transforming debt has already been reduced to #.# billion and after suffering a staggering loss of ## # million in #### the company is now solidly profitable. most important none of the changes wrought by dave have in any way undercut the topoftheline standards for safety and service that rich santulli netjets' previous ceo and the father of the fractional ownership industry insisted upon. dave and i have the strongest possible personal interest in maintaining these standards because we and our families use netjets for almost all of our flying as do many of our directors and managers. none of us are assigned special planes nor crews. we receive exactly the same treatment as any other owner meaning we pay the same prices as everyone else does when we are using our personal contracts. in short we eat our own cooking. in the aviation business no other testimonial means more. finance and financial products our largest operation in this sector is clayton homes the country's leading producer of modular and manufactured homes. clayton was not always number one a decade ago the three leading manufacturers were fleetwood champion and oakwood which together accounted for ##% of the output of the industry. all have since gone bankrupt. total industry output meanwhile has fallen from ###### units in #### to ##### units in ####. the industry is in shambles for two reasons the first of which must be lived with if the u.s. economy is to recover. this reason concerns u.s. housing starts including apartment units. in #### starts were ###### by far the lowest number in the ## years for which we have data. paradoxically this is good news. people thought it was good news a few years back when housing starts  the supply side of the picture  were running about two million annually. but household formations  the demand side  only amounted to about #.# million. after a few years of such imbalances the country unsurprisingly ended up with far too many houses. there were three ways to cure this overhang # blow up a lot of houses a tactic similar to the destruction of autos that occurred with the cashforclunkers program # speed up household formations by say encouraging teenagers to cohabitate a program not likely to suffer from a lack of volunteers or # reduce new housing starts to a number far below the rate of household formations. our country has wisely selected the third option which means that within a year or so residential housing problems should largely be behind us the exceptions being only highvalue houses and those in certain localities where overbuilding was particularly egregious. prices will remain far below bubble levels of course but for every seller or lender hurt by this there will be a buyer who benefits. indeed many families that couldn't afford to buy an appropriate home a few years ago now find it well within their means because the bubble burst. the second reason that manufactured housing is troubled is specific to the industry the punitive differential in mortgage rates between factorybuilt homes and sitebuilt homes. before you read further let me underscore the obvious berkshire has a dog in this fight and you should therefore assess the commentary that follows with special care. that warning made however let me explain why the rate differential causes problems for both large numbers of lowerincome americans and clayton. the residential mortgage market is shaped by government rules that are expressed by fha freddie mac and fannie mae. their lending standards are allpowerful because the mortgages they insure can typically be securitized and turned into what in effect is an obligation of the u.s. government. currently buyers of conventional sitebuilt homes who qualify for these guarantees can obtain a ##year loan at about # ##%. in addition these are mortgages that have recently been purchased in massive amounts by the federal reserve an action that also helped to keep rates at bargainbasement levels. in contrast very few factorybuilt homes qualify for agencyinsured mortgages. therefore a meritorious buyer of a factorybuilt home must pay about #% on his loan. for the allcash buyer clayton's homes offer terrific value. if the buyer needs mortgage financing however  and of course most buyers do  the difference in financing costs too often negates the attractive price of a factorybuilt home. ## last year i told you why our buyers  generally people with low incomes  performed so well as credit risks. their attitude was allimportant they signed up to live in the home not resell or refinance it. consequently our buyers usually took out loans with payments geared to their verified incomes we weren't making liar's loans and looked forward to the day they could burn their mortgage. if they lost their jobs had health problems or got divorced we could of course expect defaults. but they seldom walked away simply because house values had fallen. even today though jobloss troubles have grown clayton's delinquencies and defaults remain reasonable and will not cause us significant problems. we have tried to qualify more of our customers' loans for treatment similar to those available on the sitebuilt product. so far we have had only token success. many families with modest incomes but responsible habits have therefore had to forego home ownership simply because the financing differential attached to the factory built product makes monthly payments too expensive. if qualifications aren't broadened so as to open lowcost financing to all who meet downpayment and income standards the manufacturedhome industry seems destined to struggle and dwindle. even under these conditions i believe clayton will operate profitably in coming years though well below its potential. we couldn't have a better manager than ceo kevin clayton who treats berkshire's interests as if they were his own. our product is firstclass inexpensive and constantly being improved. moreover we will continue to use berkshire's credit to support clayton's mortgage program convinced as we are of its soundness. even so berkshire can't borrow at a rate approaching that available to government agencies. this handicap will limit sales hurting both clayton and a multitude of worthy families who long for a lowcost home. in the following table clayton's earnings are net of the company's payment to berkshire for the use of its credit. offsetting this cost to clayton is an identical amount of income credited to berkshire's finance operation and included in other income. the cost and income amount was ### million in #### and ## million in ####. the table also illustrates how severely our furniture cort and trailer xtra leasing operations have been hit by the recession. though their competitive positions remain as strong as ever we have yet to see any bounce in these businesses. pretax earnings in millions #### #### net investment income ### ### life and annuity operation ### ## leasing operations ## ## manufacturedhousing finance clayton ### ### other income  ### ### income before investment and derivatives gains or losses ### ### 'includes ### million in #### and ## million in #### of fees that berkshire charges clayton for the use of berkshire's credit. at the end of #### we became a ##% owner of berkadia commercial mortgage formerly known as capmark the country's thirdlargest servicer of commercial mortgages. in addition to servicing a ### billion portfolio the company is an important originator of mortgages having ## offices spread around the country. though commercial real estate will face major problems in the next few years longterm opportunities for berkadia are significant. ## our partner in this operation is leucadia run by joe steinberg and ian cumming with whom we had a terrific experience some years back when berkshire joined with them to purchase finova a troubled finance business. in resolving that situation joe and ian did far more than their share of the work an arrangement i always encourage. naturally i was delighted when they called me to partner again in the capmark purchase. our first venture was also christened berkadia. so let's call this one son of berkadia. someday i'll be writing you about grandson of berkadia. investments below we show our common stock investments that at yearend had a market value of more than # billion. ###### shares company percentage of company owned cost  market  in mi ulions ######### american express company ##.#  ####  #### ######### byd company ltd #.# ### #### ######### the cocacola company #.# #### ##### ######## conocophillips #.# #### #### ######## johnson  johnson #.# #### #### ######### kraft foods inc #.# #### #### #######

differs in a few cases because of writeups or writedowns that have been required. in addition we own positions in nontraded securities of dow chemical general electric goldman sachs swiss re and wrigley with an aggregate cost of ##.# billion and a carrying value of ##.# billion. we purchased these five positions in the last ## months. setting aside the significant equity potential they provide us these holdings deliver us an aggregate of #.# billion annually in dividends and interest. finally we owned ######## shares ##.#% of bnsf at yearend which we then carried at ##.## per share but which have subsequently been melded into our purchase of the entire company. in #### our largest sales were in conocophillips moody's procter  gamble and johnson  johnson sales of the latter occurring after we had built our position earlier in the year. charlie and i believe that all of these stocks will likely trade higher in the future. we made some sales early in #### to raise cash for our dow and swiss re purchases and late in the year made other sales in anticipation of our bnsf purchase. ## we told you last year that very unusual conditions then existed in the corporate and municipal bond markets and that these securities were ridiculously cheap relative to u.s. treasuries. we backed this view with some purchases but i should have done far more. big opportunities come infrequently. when it's raining gold reach for a bucket not a thimble. we entered #### with ##.# billion of cashequivalents and we have since retained operating earnings of ## billion. nevertheless at yearend #### our cash was down to ##.# billion with # billion earmarked for the bnsf acquisition. we've put a lot of money to work during the chaos of the last two years. it's been an ideal period for investors a climate of fear is their best friend. those who invest only when commentators are upbeat end up paying a heavy price for meaningless reassurance. in the end what counts in investing is what you pay for a business  through the purchase of a small piece of it in the stock market  and what that business earns in the succeeding decade or two. last year i wrote extensively about our derivatives contracts which were then the subject of both controversy and misunderstanding. for that discussion please go to www.berkshirehathaway.com. we have since changed only a few of our positions. some credit contracts have run off. the terms of about ##% of our equity put contracts have also changed maturities have been shortened and strike prices materially reduced. in these modifications no money changed hands. a few points from last year's discussion are worth repeating # though it's no sure thing i expect our contracts in aggregate to deliver us a profit over their lifetime even when investment income on the huge amount of float they provide us is excluded in the calculation. our derivatives float  which is not included in the ## billion of insurance float i described earlier  was about #.# billion at yearend. # only a handful of our contracts require us to post collateral under any circumstances. at last year's low point in the stock and credit markets our posting requirement was #.# billion a small fraction of the derivativesrelated float we held. when we do post collateral let me add the securities we put up continue to earn money for our account. # finally you should expect large swings in the carrying value of these contracts items that can affect our reported quarterly earnings in a huge way but that do not affect our cash or investment holdings. that thought certainly fit ####' s circumstances. here are the pretax quarterly gains and losses from derivatives valuations that were part of our reported earnings last year quarter  gain loss in billions # #.### # #.### # #.### # #.### as we've explained these wild swings neither cheer nor bother charlie and me. when we report to you we will continue to separate out these figures as we do realized investment gains and losses so that you can more clearly view the earnings of our operating businesses. we are delighted that we hold the derivatives contracts that we do. to date we have significantly profited from the float they provide. we expect also to earn further investment income over the life of our contracts. ## we have long invested in derivatives contracts that charlie and i think are mispriced just as we try to invest in mispriced stocks and bonds. indeed we first reported to you that we held such contracts in early ####. the dangers that derivatives pose for both participants and society  dangers of which we've long warned and that can be dynamite  arise when these contracts lead to leverage andor counterparty risk that is extreme. at berkshire nothing like that has occurred  nor will it. it's my job to keep berkshire far away from such problems. charlie and i believe that a ceo must not delegate risk control. it's simply too important. at berkshire i both initiate and monitor every derivatives contract on our books with the exception of operationsrelated contracts at a few of our subsidiaries such as midamerican and the minor runoff contracts at general re. if berkshire ever gets in trouble it will be my fault. it will not be because of misjudgments made by a risk committee or chief risk officer. in my view a board of directors of a huge financial institution is derelict if it does not insist that its ceo bear full responsibility for risk control. if he's incapable of handling that job he should look for other employment. and if he fails at it  with the government thereupon required to step in with funds or guarantees  the financial consequences for him and his board should be severe. it has not been shareholders who have botched the operations of some of our country's largest financial institutions. yet they have borne the burden with ##% or more of the value of their holdings wiped out in most cases of failure. collectively they have lost more than ### billion in just the four largest financial fiascos of the last two years. to say these owners have been bailedout is to make a mockery of the term. the ceos and directors of the failed companies however have largely gone unscathed. their fortunes may have been diminished by the disasters they oversaw but they still live in grand style. it is the behavior of these ceos and directors that needs to be changed if their institutions and the country are harmed by their recklessness they should pay a heavy price  one not reimbursable by the companies they've damaged nor by insurance. ceos and in many cases directors have long benefitted from oversized financial carrots some meaningful sticks now need to be part of their employment picture as well. an inconvenient truth boardroom overheating our subsidiaries made a few small bolton acquisitions last year for cash but our blockbuster deal with bnsf required us to issue about ##### berkshire shares that amounted to #.#% of those previously outstanding. charlie and i enjoy issuing berkshire stock about as much as we relish prepping for a colonoscopy. the reason for our distaste is simple. if we wouldn't dream of selling berkshire in its entirety at the current market price why in the world should we sell a significant part of the company at that same inadequate price by issuing our stock in a merger in evaluating a stockforstock offer shareholders of the target company quite understandably focus on the market price of the acquirer's shares that are to be given them. but they also expect the transaction to deliver them the intrinsic value of their own shares  the ones they are giving up. if shares of a prospective acquirer are selling below their intrinsic value it's impossible for that buyer to make a sensible deal in an allstock deal. you simply can't exchange an undervalued stock for a fullyvalued one without hurting your shareholders. imagine if you will company a and company b of equal size and both with businesses intrinsically worth ### per share. both of their stocks however sell for ## per share. the ceo of a long on confidence and short on smarts offers # va shares of a for each share of b correctly telling his directors that b is worth ### per share. he will neglect to explain though that what he is giving will cost his shareholders ### in intrinsic value. if the directors are mathematically challenged as well and a deal is therefore completed the shareholders of b will end up owning ##.#% of a  b's combined assets and a's shareholders will own ##.#%. not everyone at a it should be noted is a loser from this nonsensical transaction. its ceo now runs a company twice as large as his original domain in a world where size tends to correlate with both prestige and compensation. ## if an acquirer's stock is overvalued it's a different story using it as a currency works to the acquirer's advantage. that's why bubbles in various areas of the stock market have invariably led to serial issuances of stock by sly promoters. going by the market value of their stock they can afford to overpay because they are in effect using counterfeit money. periodically many airforassets acquisitions have taken place the late ####s having been a particularly obscene period for such chicanery. indeed certain large companies were built in this way. no one involved of course ever publicly acknowledges the reality of what is going on though there is plenty of private snickering. in our bnsf acquisition the selling shareholders quite properly evaluated our offer at ### per share. the cost to us however was somewhat higher since ##% of the ### was delivered in our shares which charlie and i believed to be worth more than their market value. fortunately we had long owned a substantial amount of bnsf stock that we purchased in the market for cash. all told therefore only about ##% of our cost overall was paid with berkshire shares. in the end charlie and i decided that the disadvantage of paying ##% of the price through stock was offset by the opportunity the acquisition gave us to deploy ## billion of cash in a business we understood and liked for the long term. it has the additional virtue of being run by matt rose whom we trust and admire. we also like the prospect of investing additional billions over the years at reasonable rates of return. but the final decision was a close one. if we had needed to use more stock to make the acquisition it would in fact have made no sense. we would have then been giving up more than we were getting. i have been in dozens of board meetings in which acquisitions have been deliberated often with the directors being instructed by highpriced investment bankers are there any other kind. invariably the bankers give the board a detailed assessment of the value of the company being purchased with emphasis on why it is worth far more than its market price. in more than fifty years of board memberships however never have i heard the investment bankers or management discuss the true value of what is being given. when a deal involved the issuance of the acquirer's stock they simply used market value to measure the cost. they did this even though they would have argued that the acquirer's stock price was woefully inadequate  absolutely no indicator of its real value  had a takeover bid for the acquirer instead been the subject up for discussion. when stock is the currency being contemplated in an acquisition and when directors are hearing from an advisor it appears to me that there is only one way to get a rational and balanced discussion. directors should hire a second advisor to make the case against the proposed acquisition with its fee contingent on the deal not going through. absent this drastic remedy our recommendation in respect to the use of advisors remains don't ask the barber whether you need a haircut. i can't resist telling you a true story from long ago. we owned stock in a large wellrun bank that for decades had been statutorily prevented from acquisitions. eventually the law was changed and our bank immediately began looking for possible purchases. its managers  fine people and able bankers  not unexpectedly began to behave like teenage boys who had just discovered girls. they soon focused on a much smaller bank also wellrun and having similar financial characteristics in such areas as return on equity interest margin loan quality etc. our bank sold at a modest price that's why we had bought into it hovering near book value and possessing a very low priceearnings ratio. alongside though the smallbank owner was being wooed by other large banks in the state and was holding out for a price close to three times book value. moreover he wanted stock not cash. naturally our fellows caved in and agreed to this valuedestroying deal. we need to show that we are in the hunt. besides it's only a small deal they said as if only major harm to shareholders would have been a legitimate reason for holding back. charlie's reaction at the time are we supposed to applaud because the dog that fouls our lawn is a chihuahua rather than a saint bernard ## the seller of the smaller bank  no fool  then delivered one final demand in his negotiations. after the merger he in effect said perhaps using words that were phrased more diplomatically than these i'm going to be a large shareholder of your bank and it will represent a huge portion of my net worth. you have to promise me therefore that you'll never again do a deal this dumb. yes the merger went through. the owner of the small bank became richer we became poorer and the managers of the big bank  newly bigger  lived happily ever after. the annual meeting our best guess is that ##### people attended the annual meeting last year up from ##  no zeros omitted  in ####. with our shareholder population much expanded we expect even more this year. therefore we will have to make a few changes in the usual routine. there will be no change however in our enthusiasm for having you attend. charlie and i like to meet you answer your questions and  best of all  have you buy lots of goods from our businesses. the meeting this year will be held on saturday may # st . as always the doors will open at the qwest center at # a.m. and a new berkshire movie will be shown

meeting at ###. if you decide to leave during the day's question periods please do so while charlie is talking. act fast he can be terse. the best reason to exit of course is to shop. we will help you do that by filling the ######square foot hall that adjoins the meeting area with products from dozens of berkshire subsidiaries. last year you did your part and most locations racked up record sales. but you can do better. a friendly warning if i find sales are lagging i get testy and lock the exits. geico will have a booth staffed by a number of its top counselors from around the country all of

hotel rooms can be hard to find but work with carol and you will get one. ## at nebraska furniture mart located on a ##acre site on ## nd street between dodge and pacific we will again be having berkshire weekend discount pricing. to obtain the berkshire discount you must make your purchases between thursday april ## th and monday may # rd inclusive and also present your meeting credential. the period's special pricing will even apply to the products of several prestigious manufacturers that normally have ironclad rules against discounting but which in the spirit of our shareholder weekend have made an exception for you. we appreciate their cooperation. nfm is open from ## a.m. to # p.m. monday through saturday and ## a.m. to # p.m. on sunday. on saturday this year from ### p.m.

overwhelmed by demand. with many more diners expected this year i've asked my friend donna sheehan at piccolo's  another favorite restaurant of mine  to serve shareholders on sunday as well. piccolo's giant root beer float is mandatory for any fan of fine dining. i plan to eat at both restaurants all of the weekend action makes me really hungry and i have favorite dishes at each spot. remember to make a reservation at gorat's call ########## on april # st but not before and at piccolo's call ##########. regrettably we will not be able to have a reception for international visitors this year. our count grew to about ### last year and my simply signing one item per person took about # vi hours. since we expect even more international visitors this year charlie and i decided we must drop this function. but be assured we welcome every international visitor who comes. last year we changed our method of determining what questions would be asked at the meeting and received many dozens of letters applauding the new arrangement. we will therefore again have the same three financial journalists lead the questionandanswer period asking charlie and me questions that shareholders have submitted to them by email. ## the journalists and their email addresses are carol loomis of fortune who may be emailed at cloomisfortunemail.com becky quick of cnbc at berkshirequestionscnbc.com and andrew ross sorkin of the new york times at arsorkinnytimes.com. from the questions submitted each journalist will choose the dozen or so he or she decides are the most interesting and important. the journalists have told me your question has the best chance of being selected if you keep it concise and include no more than two questions in any email you send them. in your email let the journalist know if you would like your name mentioned if your question is selected. neither charlie nor i will get so much as a clue about the questions to be asked. we know the journalists will pick some tough ones and that's the way we like it. we will again have a drawing at ### on saturday at each of ## microphones for those shareholders wishing to ask questions themselves. at the meeting i will alternate the questions asked by the journalists with those from the winning shareholders. we've added ## minutes to the question time and will probably have time for about ## questions from each group. at ## and ## charlie and i remain lucky beyond our dreams. we were born in america had terrific parents who saw that we got good educations have enjoyed wonderful families and great health and came equipped with a business gene that allows us to prosper in a manner hugely disproportionate to that experienced by many people who contribute as much or more to our society's wellbeing. moreover we have long had jobs that we love in which we are helped in countless ways by talented and cheerful associates. indeed over the years our work has become ever more fascinating no wonder we tapdance to work. if pushed we would gladly pay substantial sums to have our jobs but don't tell the comp committee. nothing however is more fun for us than getting together with our shareholderpartners at berkshire's annual meeting. so join us on may # st at the qwest for our annual woodstock for capitalists. we'll see you there. february ## ## # warren e. buffett chairman of the board p.s. come by

lower of cost or market which was previously the requirement. in this table berkshire's results through #### have been restated to conform to the changed rules. in all other respects the results are calculated using the numbers originally reported. the sp ### numbers are pretax whereas the berkshire numbers are aftertax. if a corporation such as berkshire were simply to have owned the sp ### and accrued the appropriate taxes its results would have lagged the sp ### in years when that index showed a positive return but would have exceeded the sp ### in years when the index showed a negative return. over the years the tax costs would have caused the aggregate lag to be substantial. # berkshire hathaway inc. to the shareholders of berkshire hathaway inc. the pershare book value of both our class a and class b stock increased by ##% in ####. over the last ## years that is since present management took over book value has grown from ## to ##### a rate of ##.#% compounded annually. the highlight of #### was our acquisition of burlington northern santa fe a purchase that's working out even better than i expected. it now appears that owning this railroad will increase berkshire's normal earning power by nearly ##% pretax and by well over ##% aftertax. making this purchase increased our share count by #% and used ## billion of cash. since we've quickly replenished the cash the economics of this transaction have turned out very well. a normal year of course is not something that either charlie munger vice chairman of berkshire and my partner or i can define with anything like precision. but for the purpose of estimating our current earning power we are envisioning a year free of a megacatastrophe in insurance and possessing a general business climate somewhat better than that of #### but weaker than that of #### or ####. using these assumptions and several others that i will explain in the investment section i can estimate that the normal earning power of the assets we currently own is about ## billion pretax and ## billion aftertax excluding any capital gains or losses. every day charlie and i think about how we can build on this base. both of us are enthusiastic about bnsf's future because railroads have major cost and environmental advantages over trucking their main competitor. last year bnsf moved each ton of freight it carried a record ### miles on a single gallon of diesel fuel. that's three times more fuelefficient than trucking is which means our railroad owns an important advantage in operating costs. concurrently our country gains because of reduced greenhouse emissions and a much smaller need for imported oil. when traffic travels by rail society benefits. over time the movement of goods in the united states will increase and bnsf should get its full share of the gain. the railroad will need to invest massively to bring about this growth but no one is better situated than berkshire to supply the funds required. however slow the economy or chaotic the markets our checks will clear. last year  in the face of widespread pessimism about our economy  we demonstrated our enthusiasm for capital investment at berkshire by spending # billion on property and equipment. of this amount #.# billion  or ##% of the total  was spent in the united states. certainly our businesses will expand abroad in the future but an overwhelming part of their future investments will be at home. in #### we will set a new record for capital spending  # billion  and spend all of the # billion increase in the united states. money will always flow toward opportunity and there is an abundance of that in america. commentators today often talk of great uncertainty. but think back for example to december # #### october ## #### and september ## ####. no matter how serene today may be tomorrow is always uncertain.  all pershare figures used in this report apply to berkshire's a shares. figures for the b shares are ## ### th of those shown for a. # don't let that reality spook you. throughout my lifetime politicians and pundits have constantly moaned about terrifying problems facing america. yet our citizens now live an astonishing six times better than when i was born. the prophets of doom have overlooked the allimportant factor that is certain human potential is far from exhausted and the american system for unleashing that potential  a system that has worked wonders for over two centuries despite frequent interruptions for recessions and even a civil war  remains alive and effective. we are not natively smarter than we were when our country was founded nor do we work harder. but look around you and see a world beyond the dreams of any colonial citizen. now as in #### #### #### and #### america's best days lie ahead. performance charlie and i believe that those entrusted with handling the funds of others should establish performance goals at the onset of their stewardship. lacking such standards managements are tempted to shoot the arrow of performance and then paint the bull'seye around wherever it lands. in berkshire's case we long ago told you that our job is to increase pershare intrinsic value at a rate greater than the increase including dividends of the sp ###. in some years we succeed in others we fail. but if we are unable over time to reach that goal we have done nothing for our investors who by themselves could have realized an equal or better result by owning an index fund. the challenge of course is the calculation of intrinsic value. present that task to charlie and me separately and you will get two different answers. precision just isn't possible. to eliminate subjectivity we therefore use an understated proxy for intrinsicvalue  book value  when measuring our performance. to be sure some of our businesses are worth far more than their carrying value on our books. later in this report we'll present a case study. but since that premium seldom swings wildly from year to year book value can serve as a reasonable device for tracking how we are doing. the table on page # shows our ##year record against the sp a performance quite good in the earlier years and now only satisfactory. the bountiful years we want to emphasize will never return. the huge sums of capital we currently manage eliminate any chance of exceptional performance. we will strive however for betterthanaverage results and feel it fair for you to hold us to that standard. yearly figures it should be noted are neither to be ignored nor viewed as allimportant. the pace of the earth's movement around the sun is not synchronized with the time required for either investment ideas or operating decisions to bear fruit. at geico for example we enthusiastically spent ### million last year on advertising to obtain policyholders who deliver us no immediate profits. if we could spend twice that amount productively we would happily do so though shortterm results would be further penalized. many large investments at our railroad and utility operations are also made with an eye to payoffs well down the road. to provide you a longerterm perspective on performance we present on the facing page the yearly figures from page # recast into a series of fiveyear periods. overall there are ## of these periods and they tell an interesting story. on a comparative basis our best years ended in the early ####s. the market's golden period however came in the ## following years with berkshire achieving stellar absolute returns even as our relative advantage narrowed. after #### the market stalled or have you already noticed that. consequently the satisfactory performance relative to the sp that berkshire has achieved since then has delivered only moderate absolute results. looking forward we hope to average several points better than the sp  though that result is of course far from a sure thing. if we succeed in that aim we will almost certainly produce better relative results in bad years for the stock market and suffer poorer results in strong markets. # berkshire's corporate performance vs. the sp ### by five year periods annual percentage change in pershare in

the third period covers ## months beginning september ## #### to december ## ####. all other periods involve calendar years. the other notes on page # also apply to this table. # intrinsic value  today and tomorrow though berkshire's intrinsic value cannot be precisely calculated two of its three key pillars can be measured. charlie and i rely heavily on these measurements when we make our own estimates of berkshire's value. the first component of value is our investments stocks bonds and cash equivalents. at yearend these totaled ### billion at market value. insurance float  money we temporarily hold in our insurance operations that does not belong to us  funds ## billion of our investments. this float is free as long as insurance underwriting breaks even meaning that the premiums we receive equal the losses and expenses we incur. of course underwriting results are volatile swinging erratically between profits and losses. over our entire history though we've been significantly profitable and i also expect us to average breakeven results or better in the future. if we do that all of our investments  those funded both by float and by retained earnings  can be viewed as an element of value for berkshire shareholders. berkshire's second component of value is earnings that come from sources other than investments and insurance underwriting. these earnings are delivered by our ## noninsurance companies itemized on page ###. in berkshire's early years we focused on the investment side. during the past two decades however we've increasingly emphasized the development of earnings from noninsurance businesses a practice that will continue. the following tables illustrate this shift. in the first table we present pershare investments at decade intervals beginning in #### three years after we entered the insurance business. we exclude those investments applicable to minority interests. pershare compounded annual increase yearend investments period in pershare investments ####  ## #### ### ######## ##.#% #### #### ######## ##.#% #### ##### ######## ##.#% #### ##### ######## #.#% though our compounded annual increase in pershare investments was a healthy ##.#% over the ##year period our rate of increase has slowed sharply as we have focused on using funds to buy operating businesses. the payoff from this shift is shown in the following table which illustrates how earnings of our noninsurance businesses have increased again on a pershare basis and after applicable minority interests. pershare compounded annual increase in year pretax earnings period pershare pretax earnings ####  #.## #### ##.## ######## ##.#% #### ###.## ######## ##.#% #### ###.## ######## ##.#% #### ####.## ######## ##.#% # for the forty years our compounded annual gain in pretax noninsurance earnings per share is ##.#%. during the same period berkshire's stock price increased at a rate of ##.#% annually. over time you can expect our stock price to move in rough tandem with berkshire's investments and earnings. market price and intrinsic value often follow very different paths  sometimes for extended periods  but eventually they meet. there is a third more subjective element to an intrinsic value calculation that can be either positive or negative the efficacy with which retained earnings will be deployed in the future. we as well as many other businesses are likely to retain earnings over the next decade that will equal or even exceed the capital we presently employ. some companies will turn these retained dollars into fiftycent pieces others into twodollar bills. this whatwilltheydowiththemoney factor must always be evaluated along with the whatdowehavenow calculation in order for us or anybody to arrive at a sensible estimate of a company's intrinsic value. that's because an outside investor stands by helplessly as management reinvests his share of the company's earnings. if a ceo can be expected to do this job well the reinvestment prospects add to the company's current value if the ceo's talents or motives are suspect today's value must be discounted. the difference in outcome can be huge. a dollar of thenvalue in the hands of sears roebuck's or montgomery ward's ceos in the late ####s had a far different destiny than did a dollar entrusted to sam walton. charlie and i hope that the pershare earnings of our noninsurance businesses continue to increase at a decent rate. but the job gets tougher as the numbers get larger. we will need both good performance from our current businesses and more major acquisitions. we're prepared. our elephant gun has been reloaded and my trigger finger is itchy. partially offsetting our anchor of size are several important advantages we have. first we possess a cadre of truly skilled managers who have an unusual commitment to their own operations and to berkshire. many of our ceos are independently wealthy and work only because they love what they do. they are volunteers not mercenaries. because no one can offer them a job they would enjoy more they can't be lured away. at berkshire managers can focus on running their businesses they are not subjected to meetings at headquarters nor financing worries nor wall street harassment. they simply get a letter from me every two years it's reproduced on pages ###### and call me when they wish. and their wishes do differ there are managers to whom i have not talked in the last year while there is one with whom i talk almost daily. our trust is in people rather than process. a hire well manage little code suits both them and me. berkshire's ceos come in many forms. some have mb as others never finished college. some use budgets and are bythebook types others operate by the seat of their pants. our team resembles a baseball squad composed of allstars having vastly different batting styles. changes in our lineup are seldom required. our second advantage relates to the allocation of the money our businesses earn. after meeting the needs of those businesses we have very substantial sums left over. most companies limit themselves to reinvesting funds within the industry in which they have been operating. that often restricts them however to a universe for capital allocation that is both tiny and quite inferior to what is available in the wider world. competition for the few opportunities that are available tends to become fierce. the seller has the upper hand as a girl might if she were the only female at a party attended by many boys. that lopsided situation would be great for the girl but terrible for the boys. at berkshire we face no institutional restraints when we deploy capital. charlie and i are limited only by our ability to understand the likely future of a possible acquisition. if we clear that hurdle  and frequently we can't  we are then able to compare any one opportunity against a host of others. # when i took control of berkshire in #### i didn't exploit this advantage. berkshire was then only in textiles where it had in the previous decade lost significant money. the dumbest thing i could have done was to pursue opportunities to improve and expand the existing textile operation  so for years that's exactly what i did. and then in a final burst of brilliance i went out and bought another textile company. aaaaaaargh eventually i came to my senses heading first into insurance and then into other industries. there is even a supplement to this worldisouroyster advantage in addition to evaluating the attractions of one business against a host of others we also measure businesses against opportunities available in marketable securities a comparison most managements don't make. often businesses are priced ridiculously high against what can likely be earned from investments in stocks or bonds. at such moments we buy securities and bide our time. our flexibility in respect to capital allocation has accounted for much of our progress to date. we have been able to take money we earn from say see's candies or business wire two of our bestrun businesses but also two offering limited reinvestment opportunities and use it as part of the stake we needed to buy bnsf. our final advantage is the hardtoduplicate culture that permeates berkshire. and in businesses culture counts. to start with the directors who represent you think and act like owners. they receive token compensation no options no restricted stock and for that matter virtually no cash. we do not provide them directors and officers liability insurance a given at almost every other large public company. if they mess up with your money they will lose their money as well. leaving my holdings aside directors and their families own berkshire shares worth more than # billion. our directors therefore monitor berkshire's actions and results with keen interest and an owner's eye. you and i are lucky to have them as stewards. this same ownerorientation prevails among our managers. in many cases these are people who have sought out berkshire as an acquirer for a business that they and their families have long owned. they came to us with an owner's mindset and we provide an environment that encourages them to retain it. having managers who love their businesses is no small advantage. cultures selfpropagate. winston churchill once said you shape your houses and then they shape you. that wisdom applies to businesses as well. bureaucratic procedures beget more bureaucracy and imperial corporate palaces induce imperious behavior. as one wag put it you know you're no longer ceo when you get in the back seat of your car and it doesn't move. at berkshire's world headquarters our annual rent is ######. moreover the homeoffice investment in furniture art coke dispenser lunch room hightech equipment  you name it  totals ######. as long as charlie and i treat your money as if it were our own berkshire's managers are likely to be careful with it as well. our compensation programs our annual meeting and even our annual reports are all designed with an eye to reinforcing the berkshire culture and making it one that will repel and expel managers of a different bent. this culture grows stronger every year and it will remain intact long after charlie and i have left the scene. we will need all of the strengths i've just described to do reasonably well. our managers will deliver you can count on that. but whether charlie and i can hold up our end in capital allocation depends in part on the competitive environment for acquisitions. you will get our best efforts. geico now let me tell you a story that will help you understand how the intrinsic value of a business can far exceed its book value. relating this tale also gives me a chance to relive some great memories. sixty years ago last month geico entered my life destined to shape it in a huge way. i was then a ##yearold graduate student at columbia having elected to go there because my hero ben graham taught a onceaweek class at the school. # one day at the library i checked out ben's entry in who's who in america and found he was chairman of government employees insurance co. now called geico. i knew nothing of insurance and had never heard of the company. the librarian however steered me to a large compendium of insurers and after reading the page on geico i decided to visit the company. the following saturday i boarded an early train for washington. alas when i arrived at the company's headquarters the building was closed. i then rather frantically started pounding on a door until finally a janitor appeared. i asked him if there was anyone in the office i could talk to and he steered me to the only person around lorimer davidson. that was my lucky moment. during the next four hours davy gave me an education about both insurance and geico. it was the beginning of a wonderful friendship. soon thereafter i graduated from columbia and became a stock salesman in omaha. geico of course was my prime recommendation which got me off to a great start with dozens of customers. geico also jumpstarted my net worth because soon after meeting davy i made the stock ##% of my #### investment portfolio. even so i felt overdiversified. subsequently davy became ceo of geico taking the company to undreamedof heights before it got into trouble in the mid####s a few years after his retirement. when that happened  with the stock falling by more than ##%  berkshire bought about onethird of the company in the market a position that over the years increased to ##% because of geico's repurchases of its own shares. berkshire's cost for this half of the business was ## million. despite the size of our position we exercised no control over operations. we then purchased the remaining ##% of geico at the beginning of #### which spurred davy at ## to make a video tape saying how happy he was that his beloved geico would permanently reside with berkshire. he also playfully concluded with next time warren please make an appointment. a lot has happened at geico during the last ## years but its core goal  saving americans substantial money on their purchase of auto insurance  remains unchanged. try us at ########### or www.geico.com. in other words get the policyholder's business by deserving his business. focusing on this objective the company has grown to be america's thirdlargest auto insurer with a market share of #.#%. when tony nicely geico's ceo took over in #### that share was #.#% a level at which it had been stuck for more than a decade. geico became a different company under tony finding a path to consistent growth while simultaneously maintaining underwriting discipline and keeping its costs low. let me quantify tony's achievement. when in #### we bought the ##% of geico we didn't already own it cost us about #.# billion. that price implied a value of #.# billion for ###%. geico then had tangible net worth of #.# billion. the excess over tangible net worth of the implied value  #.# billion  was what we estimated geico's goodwill to be worth at that time. that goodwill represented the economic value of the policyholders who were then doing business with geico. in #### those customers had paid the company #.# billion in premiums. consequently we were valuing geico's customers at about ##% #.##.# of what they were annually paying the company. by industry standards that was a very high price. but geico was no ordinary insurer because of the company's low costs its policyholders were consistently profitable and unusually loyal. today premium volume is ##.# billion and growing. yet we carry the goodwill of geico on our books at only #.# billion an amount that will remain unchanged no matter how much the value of geico increases. under accounting rules you write down the carrying value of goodwill if its economic value decreases but leave it unchanged if economic value increases. using the ##% ofpremium volume yardstick we applied to our #### purchase the real value today of geico's economic goodwill is about ## billion. and this value is likely to be much higher ten and twenty years from now. geico  off to a strong start in ####  is the gift that keeps giving. # one notsosmall footnote under tony geico has developed one of the country's largest personal lines insurance agencies which primarily sells homeowners policies to our geico auto insurance customers. in this business we represent a number of insurers that are not affiliated with us. they take the risk we simply sign up the customers. last year we sold ###### new policies at this agency operation up ##% from the year before. the obvious way this activity aids us is that it produces commission revenue equally important is the fact that it further strengthens our relationship with our policyholders helping us retain them. i owe an enormous debt to tony and davy and come to think of it to that janitor as well. now let's examine the four major sectors of berkshire. each has vastly different balance sheet and income characteristics from the others. lumping them together therefore impedes analysis. so we'll present them as four separate businesses which is how charlie and i view them. we will look first at insurance berkshire's core operation and the engine that has propelled our expansion over the years. insurance propertycasualty pc insurers receive premiums upfront and pay claims later. in extreme cases such as those arising from certain workers' compensation accidents payments can stretch over decades. this collectnow paylater model leaves us holding large sums  money we call float  that will eventually go to others. meanwhile we get to invest this float for berkshire's benefit. though individual policies and claims come and go the amount of float we hold remains remarkably stable in relation to premium volume. consequently as our business grows so does our float. and how we have grown just take a look at the following table float yearend in  millions ####  ## #### ### #### #### #### ##### #### ##### if our premiums exceed the total of our expenses and eventual losses we register an underwriting profit that adds to the investment income that our float produces. when such a profit occurs we enjoy the use of free money  and better yet get paid for holding it. alas the wish of all insurers to achieve this happy result creates intense competition so vigorous in most years that it causes the pc industry as a whole to operate at a significant underwriting loss. this loss in effect is what the industry pays to hold its float. for example state farm by far the country's largest insurer and a wellmanaged company has incurred an underwriting loss in seven of the last ten years. during that period its aggregate underwriting loss was more than ## billion. at berkshire we have now operated at an underwriting profit for eight consecutive years our total underwriting gain for the period having been ## billion. i believe it likely that we will continue to underwrite profitably in most  though certainly not all  future years. if we accomplish that our float will be better than costfree. we will benefit just as we would if some party deposited ## billion with us paid us a fee for holding its money and then let us invest its funds for our own benefit. ## let me emphasize again that costfree float is not an outcome to be expected for the pc industry as a whole in most years industry premiums have been inadequate to cover claims plus expenses. consequently the industry's overall return on tangible equity has for many decades fallen far short of the average return realized by american industry a sorry performance almost certain to continue. berkshire's outstanding economics exist only because we have some terrific managers running some unusual businesses. we've already told you about geico but we have two other very large operations and a bevy of smaller ones as well each a star in its own way. first off is the berkshire hathaway reinsurance group run by ajit jain. ajit insures risks that no one else has the desire or the capital to take on. his operation combines capacity speed decisiveness and most importantly brains in a manner that is unique in the insurance business. yet he never exposes berkshire to risks that are inappropriate in relation to our resources. indeed we are far more conservative than most large insurers in that respect. in the past year ajit has significantly increased his life reinsurance operation developing annual premium volume of about # billion that will repeat for decades. from a standing start in #### ajit has created an insurance business with float of ## billion and significant underwriting profits a feat that no ceo of any other insurer has come close to matching. by his accomplishments he has added a great many billions of dollars to the value of berkshire. even kryptonite bounces off ajit. we have another insurance powerhouse in general re managed by tad montross. at bottom a sound insurance operation requires four disciplines # an understanding of all exposures that might cause a policy to incur losses # a conservative evaluation of the likelihood of any exposure actually causing a loss and the probable cost if it does # the setting of a premium that will deliver a profit on average after both prospective loss costs and operating expenses are covered and # the willingness to walk away if the appropriate premium can't be obtained. many insurers pass the first three tests and flunk the fourth. the urgings of wall street pressures from the agency force and brokers or simply a refusal by a testosteronedriven ceo to accept shrinking volumes has led too many insurers to write business at inadequate prices. the other guy is doing it so we must as well spells trouble in any business but none more so than insurance. tad has observed all four of the insurance commandments and it shows in his results. general re's huge float has been better than costfree under his leadership and we expect that on average it will continue to be. finally we own a group of smaller companies most of them specializing in odd corners of the insurance world. in aggregate their results have consistently been profitable and as the table below shows the float they provide us is substantial. charlie and i treasure these companies and their managers. here is the record of all four segments of our propertycasualty and life insurance businesses underwriting profit yearend float in millions insurance operations #### #### #### #### general re  ###  ### ##### ##### bh reinsurance ### ### ##### ##### geico #### ### ##### #### other primary ### ## #### #### #### #### ##### ##### among large insurance operations berkshire's impresses me as the best in the world. ## manufacturing service and retailing operations our activities in this part of berkshire cover the waterfront. let's look though at a summary balance sheet and earnings statement for the entire group. balance sheet ###### in millions assets cash and equivalents  #### accounts and notes receivable #### inventory #### other current assets ### total current assets ##### goodwill and other intangibles ##### fixed assets ##### other assets #### ##### liabilities and equity notes payable #.  #### other current liabilities #### total current liabilities #### deferred taxes #### term debt and other liabilities #### equity ##### ##### earnings statement  in millions  #### #### #### revenues ##### ##### ##### operating expenses including depreciation of #### in #### #### in #### and #### in #### ##### ##### ##### interest expense ill ## ### pretax earnings #### #### #### income taxes and noncontrolling interests #### ### #### net earnings  ####  ####  #### does not include purchaseaccounting adjustments. this group of companies sells products ranging from lollipops to jet airplanes. some of the businesses enjoy terrific economics measured by earnings on unleveraged net tangible assets that run from ##% aftertax to more than ###%. others produce good returns in the area of ####%. unfortunately a few have very poor returns a result of some serious mistakes i have made in my job of capital allocation. these errors came about because i misjudged either the competitive strength of the business i was purchasing or the future economics of the industry in which it operated. i try to look out ten or twenty years when making an acquisition but sometimes my eyesight has been poor. most of the companies in this section improved their earnings last year and four set records. let's look first at the recordbreakers.  tti our electronic components distributor had sales ##% above its previous high recorded in #### and pretax earnings that topped its earlier record by ##%. its sales gains spanned three continents with north america at ##% europe at ##% and asia at ##%. the thousands of items tti distributes are pedestrian many selling for less than a dollar. the magic of tti's exceptional performance is created by paul andrews its ceo and his associates. ##  forest river our rv and boat manufacturer had record sales of nearly # billion and record earnings as well. forest river has ## plants and i have yet to visit one or the home office for that matter. there's no need pete liegl the company's ceo runs a terrific operation. come view his products at the annual meeting. better yet buy one.  ctb our farmequipment company again set an earnings record. i told you in the #### annual report about vic mancinelli the company's ceo. he just keeps getting better. berkshire paid ### million for ctb in ####. it has since paid us dividends of ### million and eliminated ## million of debt. last year it earned ### million pretax. productivity gains have produced much of this increase. when we bought ctb sales per employee were ###### now they are ######.  would you believe shoes h. h. brown run by jim issler and best known for its born brand set a new record for sales and earnings helped by its selling #### pairs of shoes at our annual meeting. jim has brilliantly adapted to major industry changes. his work i should mention is overseen by frank rooney ## a superb businessman and still a dangerous fellow with whom to have a bet on the golf course. a huge story in this sector's yeartoyear improvement occurred at netjets. i can't overstate the breadth and importance of dave sokol's achievements at this company the leading provider of fractional ownership of jet airplanes. netjets has long been an operational success owning a #### market share five times that of its nearest competitor. our overwhelming leadership stems from a wonderful team of pilots mechanics and service personnel. this crew again did its job in #### with customer satisfaction as delineated in our regular surveys hitting new highs. even though netjets was consistently a runaway winner with customers our financial results since its acquisition in #### were a failure. in the ## years through #### the company reported an aggregate pretax loss of ### million a figure that was far understated since borrowing costs at netjets were heavily subsidized by its free use of berkshire's credit. had netjets been operating on a standalone basis its loss over the years would have been several hundreds of millions greater. we are now charging netjets an appropriate fee for berkshire's guarantee. despite this fee which came to ## million in #### netjets earned ### million pretax in #### a swing of ### million from ####. dave's quick restructuring of management and the company's rationalization of its purchasing and spending policies has ended the hemorrhaging of cash and turned what was berkshire's only major business problem into a solidly profitable operation. dave has meanwhile maintained netjets' industryleading reputation for safety and service. in many important ways our training and operational standards are considerably stronger than those required by the faa. maintaining topoftheline standards is the right thing to do but i also have a selfish reason for championing this policy. my family and i have flown more than #### hours on netjets that's equal to being airborne ## hours a day for seven months and will fly thousands of hours more in the future. we receive no special treatment and have used a random mix of at least ### planes and ### crews. whichever the plane or crew we always know we are flying with the besttrained pilots in private aviation. the largest earner in our manufacturing service and retailing sector is marmon a collection of ### businesses. we will soon increase our ownership in this company to ##% by carrying out our scheduled purchase of ##% of its stock from the pritzker family. the cost will be about #.# billion. we will then purchase the remaining pritzker holdings in #### or #### whichever date is selected by the family. frank ptak runs marmon wonderfully and we look forward to ###% ownership. ## next to marmon the two largest earners in this sector are iscar and mclane. both had excellent years. in #### grady rosier' s mclane entered the wine and spirits distribution business to supplement its ## billion operation as a distributor of food products cigarettes candy and sundries. in purchasing empire distributors an operator in georgia and north carolina we teamed up with david kahn the company's dynamic ceo. david is leading our efforts to expand geographically. by yearend he had already made his first acquisition horizon wine and spirits in tennessee. at iscar profits were up ###% in #### and we may well surpass prerecession levels in ####. sales are improving throughout the world particularly in asia. credit eitan wertheimer jacob harpaz and danny goldman for an exceptional performance one far superior to that of iscar' s main competitors. all that is good news. our businesses related to home construction however continue to struggle. johns manville mitek shaw and acme brick have maintained their competitive positions but their profits are far below the levels of a few years ago. combined these operations earned ### million pretax in #### compared to #.# billion in #### and their employment has fallen by about ####. a housing recovery will probably begin within a year or so. in any event it is certain to occur at some point. consequently # at mitek we have made or committed to five bolton acquisitions during the past eleven months # at acme we just recently acquired the leading manufacturer of brick in alabama for ## million # johns manville is building a ## million roofing membrane plant in ohio to be completed next year and # shaw will spend ### million in #### on plant and equipment all of it situated in america. these businesses entered the recession strong and will exit it stronger. at berkshire our time horizon is forever. regulated capitalintensive businesses we have two very large businesses bnsf and midamerican energy with important common characteristics that distinguish them from our many others. consequently we give them their own sector in this letter and split out their financial statistics in our gaap balance sheet and income statement. a key characteristic of both companies is the huge investment they have in very longlived regulated assets with these funded by large amounts of longterm debt that is not guaranteed by berkshire. our credit is not needed both businesses have earning power that even under very adverse business conditions amply covers their interest requirements. for example in recessionary #### with bnsf's car loadings far off peak levels the company's interest coverage was ##. both companies are heavily regulated and both will have a neverending need to make major investments in plant and equipment. both also need to provide efficient customersatisfying service to earn the respect of their communities and regulators. in return both need to be assured that they will be allowed to earn reasonable earnings on future capital investments. earlier i explained just how important railroads are to our country's future. rail moves ##% of america's intercity freight measured by tonmiles and bnsf moves more than any other railroad  about ##% of the industry total. a little math will tell you that more than ##% of all intercity tonmiles of freight in the u.s. is transported by bnsf. given the shift of population to the west our share may well inch higher. all of this adds up to a huge responsibility. we are a major and essential part of the american economy's circulatory system obliged to constantly maintain and improve our ##### miles of track along with its ancillary bridges tunnels engines and cars. in carrying out this job we must anticipate society's needs not merely react to them. fulfilling our societal obligation we will regularly spend far more than our depreciation with this excess amounting to # billion in ####. i'm confident we will earn appropriate returns on our huge incremental investments. wise regulation and wise investment are two sides of the same coin. at midamerican we participate in a similar social compact. we are expected to put up ever increasing sums to satisfy the future needs of our customers. if we meanwhile operate reliably and efficiently we know that we will obtain a fair return on these investments. ## midamerican supplies #.# million customers in the u.s. with electricity operating as the largest supplier in iowa wyoming and utah and as an important provider in other states as well. our pipelines transport #% of the country's natural gas. obviously many millions of americans depend on us every day. midamerican has delivered outstanding results for both its owners berkshire's interest is ##.#% and its customers. shortly after midamerican purchased northern natural gas pipeline in #### that company's performance as a pipeline was rated dead last ## out of ## by the leading authority in the field. in the most recent report published northern natural was ranked second. the top spot was held by our other pipeline kern river. in its electric business midamerican has a comparable record. iowa rates have not increased since we purchased our operation there in ####. during the same period the other major electric utility in the state has raised prices more than ##% and now has rates far above ours. in certain metropolitan areas in which the two utilities operate side by side electric bills of our customers run far below those of their neighbors. i am told that comparable houses sell at higher prices in these cities if they are located in our service area. midamerican will have #### megawatts of wind generation in operation by the end of #### more than any other regulated electric utility in the country. the total amount that midamerican has invested or committed to wind is a staggering #.# billion. we can make this sort of investment because midamerican retains all of its earnings unlike other utilities that generally pay out most of what they earn. as you can tell by now i am proud of what has been accomplished for our society by matt rose at bnsf and by david sokol and greg abel at midamerican. i am also both proud and grateful for what they have accomplished for berkshire shareholders. below are the relevant figures midamerican earnings  in millions  #### #### u.k. utilities  ###  ### iowa utility ### ### western utilities ### ### pipelines ### ### homeservices ## ## other net ## ## operating earnings before corporate interest and taxes #### #### interest other than to berkshire ### ### interest on berkshire junior debt ## ## income tax ### ### net earnings #### #### earnings applicable to berkshire #### ####  includes interest earned by berkshire net of related income taxes of ## in #### and ## in ####. bnsf historical accounting through ##### purchase accounting subsequently in millions #### #### revenues ##### ##### operating earnings #### #### interest net ### ### pretax earnings #### #### net earnings #### #### ## finance and financial products this our smallest sector includes two rental companies xtra trailers and cort furniture and clayton homes the country's leading producer and financer of manufactured homes. both of our leasing businesses improved their performances last year albeit from a very low base. xtra increased the utilization of its equipment from ##% in #### to ##% in #### thereby raising pretax earnings to ## million from ## million in ####. cort experienced a pickup in business as the year progressed and also significantly tightened its operations. the combination increased its pretax results from a loss of # million in #### to ## million of profit in ####. at clayton we produced ##### homes ##% of the industry's total of #####. contrast this to the peak year of #### when ###### homes were manufactured. we then had an industry share of #%. sales would have been terrible last year under any circumstances but the financing problems i commented upon in the #### report continue to exacerbate the distress. to explain homefinancing policies of our government expressed through the loans found acceptable by fha freddie mac and fannie mae favor sitebuilt homes and work to negate the price advantage that manufactured homes offer. we finance more manufacturedhome buyers than any other company. our experience therefore should be instructive to those parties preparing to overhaul our country's homeloan practices. let's take a look. clayton owns ###### mortgages that it originated. it also has some mortgage portfolios that it purchased. at the origination of these contracts the average fico score of our borrowers was ### and ##% were ### or below. your banker will tell you that people with such scores are generally regarded as questionable credits. nevertheless our portfolio has performed well during conditions of stress. here's our loss experience during the last five years for originated loans net losses as a percentage year of average loans #### #.##% #### #.##% #### #.##% #### #.##% #### #.##% our borrowers get in trouble when they lose their jobs have health problems get divorced etc. the recession has hit them hard. but they want to stay in their homes and generally they borrowed sensible amounts in relation to their income. in addition we were keeping the originated mortgages for our own account which means we were not securitizing or otherwise reselling them. if we were stupid in our lending we were going to pay the price. that concentrates the mind. if home buyers throughout the country had behaved like our buyers america would not have had the crisis that it did. our approach was simply to get a meaningful downpayment and gear fixed monthly payments to a sensible percentage of income. this policy kept clayton solvent and also kept buyers in their homes. home ownership makes sense for most americans particularly at today's lower prices and bargain interest rates. all things considered the third best investment i ever made was the purchase of my home though i would have made far more money had i instead rented and used the purchase money to buy stocks. the two best investments were wedding rings. for the ##### i paid for our house my family and i gained ## years of terrific memories with more to come. ## but a house can be a nightmare if the buyer's eyes are bigger than his wallet and if a lender  often protected by a government guarantee  facilitates his fantasy. our country's social goal should not be to put families into the house of their dreams but rather to put them into a house they can afford. investments below we show our common stock investments that at yearend had a market value of more than # billion. ###### shares company percentage of company owned cost market in millions ######### american express company ##.#  ####  #### ######### byd company ltd #.# ### #### ### ooo ooo i ne vocavoia vompaiiy o.o #### ##### ######## conocophillips #.# #### #### ######## johnson  johnson #.# #### ####

market ##### ##### this is our actual purchase price and also our tax basis gaap cost differs in a few cases because of writeups or writedowns that have been required. in our reported earnings we reflect only the dividends our portfolio companies pay us. our share of the undistributed earnings of these investees however was more than # billion last year. these retained earnings are important. in our experience  and for that matter in the experience of investors over the past century  undistributed earnings have been either matched or exceeded by market gains albeit in a highly irregular manner. indeed sometimes the correlation goes in reverse. as one investor said in #### this is worse than divorce. i've lost half my net worth  and i still have my wife. in the future we expect our market gains to eventually at least equal the earnings our investees retain. in our earlier estimate of berkshire's normal earning power we made three adjustments that relate to future investment income but did not include anything for the undistributed earnings factor i have just described. the first adjustment was decidedly negative. last year we discussed five large fixedincome investments that have been contributing substantial sums to our reported earnings. one of these  our swiss re note  was redeemed in the early days of #### and two others  our goldman sachs and general electric preferred stocks  are likely to be gone by yearend. general electric is entitled to call our preferred in october and has stated its intention to do so. goldman sachs has the right to call our preferred on ## days notice but has been held back by the federal reserve bless it which unfortunately will likely give goldman the green light before long. ## all three of the companies redeeming must pay us a premium to do so  in aggregate about #.# billion  but all of the redemptions are nevertheless unwelcome. after they occur our earning power will be significantly reduced. that's the bad news. there are two probable offsets. at yearend we held ## billion of cash equivalents that have been earning a pittance throughout ####. at some point however better rates will return. they will add at least ### million  and perhaps much more  to our investment income. that sort of increase in moneymarket yields is unlikely to come soon. it is appropriate nevertheless for us to include improved rates in an estimate of normal earning power. even before higher rates come about furthermore we could get lucky and find an opportunity to use some of our cash hoard at decent returns. that day can't come too soon for me to update aesop a girl in a convertible is worth five in the phone book. in addition dividends on our current common stock holdings will almost certainly increase. the largest gain is likely to come at wells fargo. the federal reserve our friend in respect to goldman sachs has frozen dividend levels at major banks whether strong or weak during the last two years. wells fargo though consistently prospering throughout the worst of the recession and currently enjoying enormous financial strength and earning power has therefore been forced to maintain an artificially low payout. we don't fault the fed for various reasons an acrosstheboard freeze made sense during the crisis and its immediate aftermath. at some point probably soon the fed's restrictions will cease. wells fargo can then reinstate the rational dividend policy that its owners deserve. at that time we would expect our annual dividends from just this one security to increase by several hundreds of millions of dollars annually. other companies we hold are likely to increase their dividends as well. cocacola paid us ## million in #### the year after we finished purchasing the stock. every year since coke has increased its dividend. in #### we will almost certainly receive ### million from coke up ## million from last year. within ten years i would expect that ### million to double. by the end of that period i wouldn't be surprised to see our share of coke's annual earnings exceed ###% of what we paid for the investment. time is the friend of the wonderful business. overall i believe our normal investment income will at least equal what we realized in #### though the redemptions i described will cut our take in #### and perhaps #### as well. last summer lou simpson told me he wished to retire. since lou was a mere ##  an age charlie and i regard as appropriate only for trainees at berkshire  his call was a surprise. lou joined geico as its investment manager in #### and his service to that company has been invaluable. in the #### annual report i detailed his record with equities and i have omitted updates only because his performance made mine look bad. who needs that lou has never been one to advertise his talents. but i will simply put lou is one of the investment greats. we will miss him. four years ago i told you that we needed to add one or more younger investment managers to carry on when charlie lou and i weren't around. at that time we had multiple outstanding candidates immediately available for my ceo job as we do now but we did not have backup in the investment area. it's easy to identify many investment managers with great recent records. but past results though important do not suffice when prospective performance is being judged. how the record has been achieved is crucial as is the manager's understanding of  and sensitivity to  risk which in no way should be measured by beta the choice of too many academics. in respect to the risk criterion we were looking for someone with a hardtoevaluate skill the ability to anticipate the effects of economic scenarios not previously observed. finally we wanted someone who would regard working for berkshire as far more than a job. ## when charlie and i met todd combs we knew he fit our requirements. todd as was the case with lou will be paid a salary plus a contingent payment based on his performance relative to the sp. we have arrangements in place for deferrals and carryforwards that will prevent seesaw performance being met by undeserved payments. the hedgefund world has witnessed some terrible behavior by general partners who have received huge payouts on the upside and who then when bad results occurred have walked away rich with their limited partners losing back their earlier gains. sometimes these same general partners thereafter quickly started another fund so that they could immediately participate in future profits without having to overcome their past losses. investors who put money with such managers should be labeled patsies not partners. as long as i am ceo i will continue to manage the great majority of berkshire's holdings both bonds and equities. todd initially will manage funds in the range of one to three billion dollars an amount he can reset annually. his focus will be equities but he is not restricted to that form of investment. fund consultants like to require style boxes such as longshort macro international equities. at berkshire our only style box is smart. over time we may add one or two investment managers if we find the right individuals. should we do that we will probably have ##% of each manager's performance compensation be dependent on his or her own portfolio and ##% on that of the other managers. we want a compensation system that pays off big for individual success but that also fosters cooperation not competition. when charlie and i are no longer around our investment managers will have responsibility for the entire portfolio in a manner then set by the ceo and board of directors. because good investors bring a useful perspective to the purchase of businesses we would expect them to be consulted  but not to have a vote  on the wisdom of possible acquisitions. in the end of course the board will make the call on any major acquisition. one footnote when we issued a press release about todd's joining us a number of commentators pointed out that he was littleknown and expressed puzzlement that we didn't seek a bigname. i wonder how many of them would have known of lou in #### ajit in #### or for that matter charlie in ####. our goal was to find a #yearold secretariat not a ##yearold seabiscuit. whoops  that may not be the smartest metaphor for an ##yearold ceo to use. derivatives two years ago in the #### annual report i told you that berkshire was a party to ### derivatives contracts other than those used for operations at our subsidiaries such as midamerican and the few left over at gen re. today the comparable number is ### a figure reflecting both a few additions to our portfolio and the unwinding or expiration of some contracts. our continuing positions all of which i am personally responsible for fall largely into two categories. we view both categories as engaging us in insurancelike activities in which we receive premiums for assuming risks that others wish to shed. indeed the thought processes we employ in these derivatives transactions are identical to those we use in our insurance business. you should also understand that we get paid upfront when we enter into the contracts and therefore run no counterparty risk. that's important. our first category of derivatives consists of a number of contracts written in ######## that required payments by us if there were bond defaults by companies included in certain highyield indices. with minor exceptions we were exposed to these risks for five years with each contract covering ### companies. in aggregate we received premiums of #.# billion for these contracts. when i originally told you in our #### annual report about them i said that i expected the contracts would deliver us an underwriting profit meaning that our losses would be less than the premiums we received. in addition i said we would benefit from the use of float. ## subsequently as you know too well we encountered both a financial panic and a severe recession. a number of the companies in the highyield indices failed which required us to pay losses of #.# billion. today however our exposure is largely behind us because most of our higherrisk contracts have expired. consequently it appears almost certain that we will earn an underwriting profit as we originally anticipated. in addition we have had the use of interestfree float that averaged about # billion over the life of the contracts. in short we charged the right premium and that protected us when business conditions turned terrible three years ago. our other large derivatives position  whose contracts go by the name of equity puts  involves insurance we wrote for parties wishing to protect themselves against a possible decline in equity prices in the u.s. u.k. europe and japan. these contracts are tied to various equity indices such as the sp ### in the u.s. and the ftse ### in the u.k. in the ######## period we received #.# billion of premiums for ## of these contracts most of which ran for ## years. on these contracts only the price of the indices on the termination date counts no payments can be required before then. as a first step in updating you about these contracts i can report that late in #### at the instigation of our counterparty we unwound eight contracts all of them due between #### and ####. we had originally received ### million in premiums for these contracts and the unwinding required us to pay ### million. consequently we realized a gain of ### million and also had the interestfree and unrestricted use of that ### million for about three years. those #### transactions left us with ## equity put contracts remaining on our books at yearend. on these at their initiation we received premiums of #.# billion. the future of these contracts is of course uncertain. but here is one perspective on them. if the prices of the relevant indices are the same at the contract expiration dates as these prices were on december ## ####  and foreign exchange rates are unchanged  we would owe #.# billion on expirations occurring from #### to ####. you can call this amount settlement value. on our yearend balance sheet however we carry the liability for those remaining equity puts at #.# billion. in other words if the prices of the relevant indices remain unchanged from that date we will record a #.# billion gain in the years to come that being the difference between the liability figure of #.# billion and the settlement value of #.# billion. i believe that equity prices will very likely increase and that our liability will fall significantly between now and settlement date. if so our gain from this point will be even greater. but that of course is far from a sure thing. what is sure is that we will have the use of our remaining float of #.# billion for an average of about ## more years. neither this float nor that arising from the highyield contracts is included in the insurance float figure of ## billion. since money is fungible think of a portion of these funds as contributing to the purchase of bnsf. as i have told you before almost all of our derivatives contracts are free of any obligation to post collateral  a fact that cut the premiums we could otherwise have charged. but that fact also left us feeling comfortable during the financial crisis allowing us in those days to commit to some advantageous purchases. foregoing some additional derivatives premiums proved to be well worth it. on reporting and misreporting the numbers that count and those that don't earlier in this letter i pointed out some numbers that charlie and i find useful in valuing berkshire and measuring its progress. let's focus here on a number we omitted but which many in the media feature above all others net income. important though that number may be at most companies it is almost always meaningless at berkshire. regardless of how our businesses might be doing charlie and i could  quite legally  cause net income in any given period to be almost any number we would like. ## we have that flexibility because realized gains or losses on investments go into the net income figure whereas unrealized gains and in most cases losses are excluded. for example imagine that berkshire had a ## billion increase in unrealized gains in a given year and concurrently had # billion of realized losses. our net income  which would count only the loss  would be reported as less than our operating income. if we had meanwhile realized gains in the previous year headlines might proclaim that our earnings were down x% when in reality our business might be much improved. if we really thought net income important we could regularly feed realized gains into it simply because we have a huge amount of unrealized gains upon which to draw. rest assured though that charlie and i have never sold a security because of the effect a sale would have on the net income we were soon to report. we both have a deep disgust for game playing with numbers a practice that was rampant throughout corporate america in the ####s and still persists though it occurs less frequently and less blatantly than it used to. operating earnings despite having some shortcomings are in general a reasonable guide as to how our businesses are doing. ignore our net income figure however. regulations require that we report it to you. but if you find reporters focusing on it that will speak more to their performance than ours. both realized and unrealized gains and losses are fully reflected in the calculation of our book value. pay attention to the changes in that metric and to the course of our operating earnings and you will be on the right track. as a p.s. i can't resist pointing out just how capricious reported net income can be. had our equity puts had a termination date of june ## #### we would have been required to pay #.# billion to our counterparties at that date. security prices then generally rose in the next quarter a move that brought the corresponding figure down to #.# billion on september ##th. yet the blackscholes formula that we use in valuing these contracts required us to increase our balancesheet liability during this period from #.# billion to #.# billion a change that after the effect of tax accruals reduced our net income for the quarter by ### million. both charlie and i believe that blackscholes produces wildly inappropriate values when applied to longdated options. we set out one absurd example in these pages two years ago. more tangibly we put our money where our mouth was by entering into our equity put contracts. by doing so we implicitly asserted that the blackscholes calculations used by our counterparties or their customers were faulty. we continue nevertheless to use that formula in presenting our financial statements. blackscholes is the accepted standard for option valuation  almost all leading business schools teach it  and we would be accused of shoddy accounting if we deviated from it. moreover we would present our auditors with an insurmountable problem were we to do that they have clients who are our counterparties and who use black scholes values for the same contracts we hold. it would be impossible for our auditors to attest to the accuracy of both their values and ours were the two far apart. part of the appeal of blackscholes to auditors and regulators is that it produces a precise number. charlie and i can't supply one of those. we believe the true liability of our contracts to be far lower than that calculated by blackscholes but we can't come up with an exact figure  anymore than we can come up with a precise value for geico bnsf or for berkshire hathaway itself. our inability to pinpoint a number doesn't bother us we would rather be approximately right than precisely wrong. john kenneth galbraith once slyly observed that economists were most economical with ideas they made the ones learned in graduate school last a lifetime. university finance departments often behave similarly. witness the tenacity with which almost all clung to the theory of efficient markets throughout the ####s and ####s dismissively calling powerful facts that refuted it anomalies. i always love explanations of that kind the flat earth society probably views a ship's circling of the globe as an annoying but inconsequential anomaly. ## academics' current practice of teaching blackscholes as revealed truth needs reexamination. for that matter so does the academic's inclination to dwell on the valuation of options. you can be highly successful as an investor without having the slightest ability to value an option. what students should be learning is how to value a business. that's what investing is all about. life and debt the fundamental principle of auto racing is that to finish first you must first finish. that dictum is equally applicable to business and guides our every action at berkshire. unquestionably some people have become very rich through the use of borrowed money. however that's also been a way to get very poor. when leverage works it magnifies your gains. your spouse thinks you're clever and your neighbors get envious. but leverage is addictive. once having profited from its wonders very few people retreat to more conservative practices. and as we all learned in third grade  and some relearned in ####  any series of positive numbers however impressive the numbers may be evaporates when multiplied by a single zero. history tells us that leverage all too often produces zeroes even when it is employed by very smart people. leverage of course can be lethal to businesses as well. companies with large debts often assume that these obligations can be refinanced as they mature. that assumption is usually valid. occasionally though either because of companyspecific problems or a worldwide shortage of credit maturities must actually be met by payment. for that only cash will do the job. borrowers then learn that credit is like oxygen. when either is abundant its presence goes unnoticed. when either is missing that's all that is noticed. even a short absence of credit can bring a company to its knees. in september #### in fact its overnight disappearance in many sectors of the economy came dangerously close to bringing our entire country to its knees. charlie and i have no interest in any activity that could pose the slightest threat to berkshire's well being. with our having a combined age of ### starting over is not on our bucket list. we are forever conscious of the fact that you our partners have entrusted us with what in many cases is a major portion of your savings. in addition important philanthropy is dependent on our prudence. finally many disabled victims of accidents caused by our insureds are counting on us to deliver sums payable decades from now. it would be irresponsible for us to risk what all these constituencies need just to pursue a few points of extra return. a little personal history may partially explain our extreme aversion to financial adventurism. i didn't meet charlie until he was ## though he grew up within ### yards of where i have lived for ## years and also attended the same innercity public high school in omaha from which my father wife children and two grandchildren graduated. charlie and i did however both work as young boys at my grandfather's grocery store though our periods of employment were separated by about five years. my grandfather's name was ernest and perhaps no man was more aptly named. no one worked for ernest even as a stock boy without being shaped by the experience. on the facing page you can read a letter sent in #### by ernest to his youngest son my uncle fred. similar letters went to his other four children. i still have the letter sent to my aunt alice which i found  along with #### of cash  when as executor of her estate i opened her safe deposit box in ####. ernest never went to business school  he never in fact finished high school  but he understood the importance of liquidity as a condition for assured survival. at berkshire we have taken his #### solution a bit further and have pledged that we will hold at least ## billion of cash excluding that held at our regulated utility and railroad businesses. because of that commitment we customarily keep at least ## billion on hand so that we can both withstand unprecedented insurance losses our largest to date having been about # billion from katrina the insurance industry's most expensive catastrophe and quickly seize acquisition or investment opportunities even during times of financial turmoil. ## dear fred  catherine over a period of a good many years i have known a great many people who at some time or another have suffered in various ways simply because they did not have ready cash. i have known people who have had to sacrifice some of their holdings in order to have money that was necessary at that time for a good many years your grandfather kept a certain amount of money where he could put his hands on it in very short notice for a number of years i have made it a point to keep a reserve should some occasion come up where i would need money quickly with out disturbing the money that i have in my business. there have been a couple occasions when i found it very convenient to go to this fund thus i feel that everyone should have a reserve. i hope it never happens to you but the chances are that some day you v### need money and need it badly and with this thought in view i started a fund by placing sqo## in an envelopewith your name on it when you were married. each year i added something to it until there is now ####.## in the fund ten years have elapsed since you were married and this fund is now completed it is my wish that you place this envelope in your safety deposit box and keep it for the purpose that it was created for. should the time come when you need part i wohld suggest that you use as little as possible and replace it as soon as possible you might feel that this should be invested and bring you an income. forget it  the mental satisfaction of having ###### laid away where you can put your hands on it is worth more than what interest it might bring especially if you have the investment in something that you could not realize on quickly if in after years you feel this has been a good idea you might repeat it with your own ohildren for your information i might mention that there has never been a buffett who ever left a very large estate but there has never been one that did not leave something they never spent all they made but always saved part of what they made and it has all worked out pretty well this letter is being written at the expiration of ten years after you were married ## we keep our cash largely in u.s. treasury bills and avoid other shortterm securities yielding a few more basis points a policy we adhered to long before the frailties of commercial paper and money market funds became apparent in september ####. we agree with investment writer ray devoe's observation more money has been lost reaching for yield than at the point of a gun. at berkshire we don't rely on bank lines and we don't enter into contracts that could require postings of collateral except for amounts that are tiny in relation to our liquid assets. furthermore not a dime of cash has left berkshire for dividends or share repurchases during the past ## years. instead we have retained all of our earnings to strengthen our business a reinforcement now running about # billion per month. our net worth has thus increased from ## million to ### billion during those four decades and our intrinsic value has grown far more. no other american corporation has come close to building up its financial strength in this unrelenting way. by being so cautious in respect to leverage we penalize our returns by a minor amount. having loads of liquidity though lets us sleep well. moreover during the episodes of financial chaos that occasionally erupt in our economy we will be equipped both financially and emotionally to play offense while others scramble for survival. that's what allowed us to invest ##.# billion in ## days of panic following the lehman bankruptcy in ####. the annual meeting the annual meeting will be held on saturday april ## th . carrie kizer from our home office will be the ringmaster and her theme this year is planes trains and automobiles. this gives netjets bnsf and byd a chance to show off. as always the doors will open at the qwest center at # a.m. and a new berkshire movie will be shown at ###. at ### we will go directly to the

berkshire weekend. if you are coming from far away compare the cost of flying to kansas city versus omaha. the drive is about # vi hours and it may be that you can save significant money particularly if you had planned to rent a car in omaha. at nebraska furniture mart located on a ##acre site on ## nd street between dodge and pacific we will again be having berkshire weekend discount pricing. last year the store did ##.# million of business during its annual meeting sale a volume that  as far as i know  exceeds the oneweek total of any retail store anyplace. to obtain the berkshire discount you must make your purchases between tuesday april ## th and monday may # nd inclusive and also present your meeting credential. the period's special pricing will even apply to the products of several prestigious manufacturers that normally have ironclad rules against discounting but which in the spirit of our shareholder weekend have made an exception for you. we appreciate their

st but not before and at piccolo's call ##########. we will again have the same three financial journalists lead the questionandanswer period asking charlie and me questions that shareholders have submitted to them by email. the journalists and their email addresses are carol loomis of fortune who may be emailed at cloomisfortunemail.com becky quick of cnbc at berkshirequestionscnbc.com and andrew ross sorkin of the new york times at arsorkin  nytimes.com. from the questions submitted each journalist will choose the dozen or so he or she decides are the most interesting and important. the journalists have told me your question has the best chance of being selected if you keep it concise avoid sending it in at the last moment make it berkshirerelated and include no more than two questions in any email you send them. in your email let the journalist know if you would like your name mentioned if your question is selected. neither charlie nor i will get so much as a clue about the questions to be asked. we know the journalists will pick some tough ones and that's the way we like it. ## we will again have a drawing at ### a.m. on saturday at each of ## microphones for those shareholders wishing to ask questions themselves. at the meeting i will alternate the questions asked by the journalists with those from the winning shareholders. we hope to answer at least ## questions. from our standpoint the more the better. our goal which we pursue both through these annual letters and by our meeting discussions is to give you a better understanding of the business that you own. for good reason i regularly extol the accomplishments of our operating managers. equally important however are the ## men and women who work with me at our corporate office all on one floor which is the way we intend to keep it. this group efficiently deals with a multitude of sec and other regulatory requirements files a ##### page federal income tax return along with state and foreign returns responds to countless shareholder and media inquiries gets out the annual report prepares for the country's largest annual meeting coordinates the board's activities  and the list goes on and on. they handle all of these business tasks cheerfully and with unbelievable efficiency making my life easy and joyful. their efforts go beyond activities strictly related to berkshire they deal with ## universities selected from ### applicants who will send students to omaha this school year for a day with me and also handle all kinds of requests that i receive arrange my travel and even get me hamburgers for lunch. no ceo has it better. this home office crew has my deepest thanks and deserves yours as well. come to our woodstock for capitalism on april ## th and tell them so. february ## ## # # warren e. buffett chairman of the board ## memo to berkshire hathaway managers the allstars cc berkshire directors from warren e. buffett date july ## #### this is my biennial letter to reemphasize berkshire's top priority and to get your help on succession planning yours not mine. the priority is that all of us continue to zealously guard berkshire's reputation. we can't be perfect but we can try to be. as i've said in these memos for more than ## years we can afford to lose money  even a lot of money. but we can't afford to lose reputation  even a shred of reputation. we must continue to measure every act against not only what is legal but also what we would be happy to have written about on the front page of a national newspaper in an article written by an unfriendly but intelligent reporter. sometimes your associates will say everybody else is doing it. this rationale is almost always a bad one if it is the main justification for a business action. it is totally unacceptable when evaluating a moral decision. whenever somebody offers that phrase as a rationale in effect they are saying that they can't come up with a good reason. if anyone gives this explanation tell them to try using it with a reporter or a judge and see how far it gets them. if you see anything whose propriety or legality causes you to hesitate be sure to give me a call. however it's very likely that if a given course of action evokes such hesitation it's too close to the line and should be abandoned. there's plenty of money to be made in the center of the court. if it's questionable whether some action is close to the line just assume it is outside and forget it. as a corollary let me know promptly if there's any significant bad news. i can handle bad news but i don't like to deal with it after it has festered for awhile. a reluctance to face up immediately to bad news is what turned a problem at salomon from one that could have easily been disposed of into one that almost caused the demise of a firm with #### employees. ### somebody is doing something today at berkshire that you and i would be unhappy about if we knew of it. that's inevitable we now employ more than ###### people and the chances of that number getting through the day without any bad behavior occurring is nil. but we can have a huge effect in minimizing such activities by jumping on anything immediately when there is the slightest odor of impropriety. your attitude on such matters expressed by behavior as well as words will be the most important factor in how the culture of your business develops. culture more than rule books determines how an organization behaves. in other respects talk to me about what is going on as little or as much as you wish. each of you does a firstclass job of running your operation with your own individual style and you don't need me to help. the only items you need to clear with me are any changes in postretirement benefits and any unusually large capital expenditures or acquisitions. i need your help in respect to the question of succession. i'm not looking for any of you to retire and i hope you all live to ###. in charlie's case # ##. but just in case you don't please send me a letter at home if you wish giving your recommendation as who should take over tomorrow if you should become incapacitated overnight. these letters will be seen by no one but me unless i'm no longer ceo in which case my successor will need the information. please summarize the strengths and weaknesses of your primary candidate as well as any possible alternates you may wish to include. most of you have participated in this exercise in the past and others have offered your ideas verbally. however it's important to me to get a periodic update and now that we have added so many businesses i need to have your thoughts in writing rather than trying to carry them around in my memory. of course there are a few operations that are run by two or more of you  such as the blumkins the merschmans the pair at applied underwriters etc.  and in these cases just forget about this item. your note can be short informal handwritten etc. just mark it personal for warren. thanks for your help on all of this. and thanks for the way you run your businesses. you make my job easy. webdb p.s. another minor request please turn down all proposals for me to speak make contributions intercede with the gates foundation etc. sometimes these requests for you to act as intermediary will be accompanied by it can't hurt to ask. it will be easier for both of us if you just say no. as an added favor don't suggest that they instead write or call me. multiply ## businesses by the periodic i think he'll be interested in this one and you can understand why it is better to say no firmly and immediately. ### berkshire hathaway inc. to the shareholders of berkshire hathaway inc. the pershare book value of both our class a and class b stock increased by #.#% in ####. over the last ## years that is since present management took over book value has grown from ## to ##### a rate of ##.#% compounded annually. charlie munger berkshire's vice chairman and my partner and i feel good about the company's progress during ### #. here are the highlights  the primary job of a board of directors is to see that the right people are running the business and to be sure that the next generation of leaders is identified and ready to take over tomorrow. i have been on ## corporate boards and berkshire's directors are at the top of the list in the time and diligence they have devoted to succession planning. what's more their efforts have paid off. as #### started todd combs joined us as an investment manager and shortly after yearend ted weschler came aboard. both of these men have outstanding investment skills and a deep commitment to berkshire. each will be handling a few billion dollars in #### but they have the brains judgment and character to manage our entire portfolio when charlie and i are no longer running berkshire. your board is equally enthusiastic about my successor as ceo an individual to whom they have had a great deal of exposure and whose managerial and human qualities they admire. we have two superb backup candidates as well. when a transfer of responsibility is required it will be seamless and berkshire's prospects will remain bright. more than ##% of my net worth is in berkshire stock all of which will go to various philanthropies. being so heavily concentrated in one stock defies conventional wisdom. but i'm fine with this arrangement knowing both the quality and diversity of the businesses we own and the caliber of the people who manage them. with these assets my successor will enjoy a running start. do not however infer from this discussion that charlie and i are going anywhere we continue to be in excellent health and we love what we do.  on september ## th we acquired lubrizol a worldwide producer of additives and other specialty chemicals. the company has had an outstanding record since james hambrick became ceo in #### with pretax profits increasing from ### million to #### million. lubrizol will have many opportunities for bolton acquisitions in the specialty chemical field. indeed we've already agreed to three costing ### million. james is a disciplined buyer and a superb operator. charlie and i are eager to expand his managerial domain.  our major businesses did well last year. in fact each of our five largest noninsurance companies  bnsf iscar lubrizol marmon group and midamerican energy  delivered record operating earnings. in aggregate these businesses earned more than # billion pretax in ####. contrast that to seven years ago when we owned only one of the five midamerican whose pretax earnings were ### million. unless the economy weakens in #### each of our fabulous five should again set a record with aggregate earnings comfortably topping ## billion.  all pershare figures used in this report apply to berkshire's a shares. figures for the b shares are ## ### th of those shown for a. # in total our entire string of operating companies spent #.# billion for property plant and equipment in #### smashing our previous record by more than # billion. about ##% of these outlays were made in the u.s. a fact that may surprise those who believe our country lacks investment opportunities. we welcome projects abroad but expect the overwhelming majority of berkshire's future capital commitments to be in america. in #### these expenditures will again set a record. our insurance operations continued their delivery of costless capital that funds a myriad of other opportunities. this business produces float  money that doesn't belong to us but that we get to invest for berkshire's benefit. and if we pay out less in losses and expenses than we receive in premiums we additionally earn an underwriting profit meaning the float costs us less than nothing. though we are sure to have underwriting losses from time to time we've now had nine consecutive years of underwriting profits totaling about ## billion. over the same nine years our float increased from ## billion to its current record of ## billion. insurance has been good to us. finally we made two major investments in marketable securities # a # billion #% preferred stock of bank of america that came with warrants allowing us to buy ### million common shares at #.## per share any time before september # #### and # ##.# million shares of ibm that cost us ##.# billion. counting ibm we now have large ownership interests in four exceptional companies ##.#% of american express #.#% of cocacola #.#% of ibm and #.#% of wells fargo. we also of course have many smaller but important positions. we view these holdings as partnership interests in wonderful businesses not as marketable securities to be bought or sold based on their nearterm prospects. our share of their earnings however are far from fully reflected in our earnings only the dividends we receive from these businesses show up in our financial reports. over time though the undistributed earnings of these companies that are attributable to our ownership are of huge importance to us. that's because they will be used in a variety of ways to increase future earnings and dividends of the investee. they may also be devoted to stock repurchases which will increase our share of the company's future earnings. had we owned our present positions throughout last year our dividends from the big four would have been ### million. that's all that would have been reported in berkshire's income statement. our share of this quartet's earnings however would have been far greater #.# billion. charlie and i believe that the #.# billion that goes unreported on our books creates at least that amount of value for berkshire as it fuels earnings gains in future years. we expect the combined earnings of the four  and their dividends as well  to increase in #### and for that matter almost every year for a long time to come. a decade from now our current holdings of the four companies might well account for earnings of # billion of which # billion in dividends would come to us. i've run out of good news. here are some developments that hurt us during ### # a few years back i spent about # billion buying several bond issues of energy future holdings an electric utility operation serving portions of texas. that was a mistake  a big mistake. in large measure the company's prospects were tied to the price of natural gas which tanked shortly after our purchase and remains depressed. though we have annually received interest payments of about ### million since our purchase the company's ability to pay will soon be exhausted unless gas prices rise substantially. we wrote down our investment by # billion in #### and by an additional ### million last year. at yearend we carried the bonds at their market value of ### million. if gas prices remain at present levels we will likely face a further loss perhaps in an amount that will virtually wipe out our current carrying value. conversely a substantial increase in gas prices might allow us to recoup some or even all of our writedown. however things turn out i totally miscalculated the gainloss probabilities when i purchased the bonds. in tennis parlance this was a major unforced error by your chairman. #  three large and very attractive fixedincome investments were called away from us by their issuers in ####. swiss re goldman sachs and general electric paid us an aggregate of ##.# billion to redeem securities that were producing about #.# billion of pretax earnings for berkshire. that's a lot of income to replace though our lubrizol purchase did offset most of it.  last year i told you that a housing recovery will probably begin within a year or so. i was dead wrong. we have five businesses whose results are significantly influenced by housing activity. the connection is direct at clayton homes which is the largest producer of homes in the country accounting for about #% of those constructed during ### #. additionally acme brick shaw carpet johns manville insulation and mitek building products primarily connector plates used in roofing are all materially affected by construction activity. in aggregate our five housingrelated companies had pretax profits of ### million in ####. that's similar to #### but down from #.# billion in ####. housing will come back  you can be sure of that. over time the number of housing units necessarily matches the number of households after allowing for a normal level of vacancies. for a period of years prior to #### however america added more housing units than households. inevitably we ended up with far too many units and the bubble popped with a violence that shook the entire economy. that created still another problem for housing early in a recession household formations slow and in #### the decrease was dramatic. that devastating supplydemand equation is now reversed every day we are creating more households than housing units. people may postpone hitching up during uncertain times but eventually hormones take over. and while doublingup may be the initial reaction of some during a recession living with inlaws can quickly lose its allure. at our current annual pace of ###### housing starts  considerably less than the number of new households being formed  buyers and renters are sopping up what's left of the old oversupply. this process will run its course at different rates around the country the supplydemand situation varies widely by locale. while this healing takes place however our housingrelated companies sputter employing only ##### people compared to ##### in ####. this hugely important sector of the economy which includes not only construction but everything that feeds off of it remains in a depression of its own. i believe this is the major reason a recovery in employment has so severely lagged the steady and substantial comeback we have seen in almost all other sectors of our economy. wise monetary and fiscal policies play an important role in tempering recessions but these tools don't create households nor eliminate excess housing units. fortunately demographics and our market system will restore the needed balance  probably before long. when that day comes we will again build one million or more residential units annually. i believe pundits will be surprised at how far unemployment drops once that happens. they will then reawake to what has been true since #### america's best days lie ahead. intrinsic business value charlie and i measure our performance by the rate of gain in berkshire's pershare intrinsic business value. if our gain over time outstrips the performance of the sp ### we have earned our paychecks. if it doesn't we are overpaid at any price. we have no way to pinpoint intrinsic value. but we do have a useful though considerably understated proxy for it pershare book value. this yardstick is meaningless at most companies. at berkshire however book value very roughly tracks business values. that's because the amount by which berkshire's intrinsic value exceeds book value does not swing wildly from year to year though it increases in most years. over time the divergence will likely become ever more substantial in absolute terms remaining reasonably steady however on a percentage basis as both the numerator and denominator of the businessvaluebookvalue equation increase. # we've regularly emphasized that our bookvalue performance is almost certain to outpace the sp ### in a bad year for the stock market and just as certainly will fall short in a strong upyear. the test is how we do over time. last year's annual report included a table laying out results for the ## fiveyear periods since we took over at berkshire in #### i.e. ###### ###### etc.. all showed our book value beating the sp and our string held for ######. it will almost certainly snap though if the sp ### should put together a fiveyear winning streak which it may well be on its way to doing as i write this. i also included two tables last year that set forth the key quantitative ingredients that will help you estimate our pershare intrinsic value. i won't repeat the full discussion here you can find it reproduced on pages #####. to update the tables shown there our pershare investments in ### # increased #% to ##### and our pretax earnings from businesses other than insurance and investments increased ##% to #### per share. charlie and i like to see gains in both areas but our primary focus is on building operating earnings. over time the businesses we currently own should increase their aggregate earnings and we hope also to purchase some large operations that will give us a further boost. we now have eight subsidiaries that would each be included in the fortune ### were they standalone companies. that leaves only ### to go. my task is clear and i'm on the prowl. share repurchases last september we announced that berkshire would repurchase its shares at a price of up to ###% of book value. we were in the market for only a few days  buying ## million of stock  before the price advanced beyond our limit. nonetheless the general importance of share repurchases suggests i should focus for a bit on the subject. charlie and i favor repurchases when two conditions are met first a company has ample funds to take care of the operational and liquidity needs of its business second its stock is selling at a material discount to the company's intrinsic business value conservatively calculated. we have witnessed many bouts of repurchasing that failed our second test. sometimes of course infractions  even serious ones  are innocent many ceos never stop believing their stock is cheap. in other instances a less benign conclusion seems warranted. it doesn't suffice to say that repurchases are being made to offset the dilution from stock issuances or simply because a company has excess cash. continuing shareholders are hurt unless shares are purchased below intrinsic value. the first law of capital allocation  whether the money is slated for acquisitions or share repurchases  is that what is smart at one price is dumb at another. one ceo who always stresses the pricevalue factor in repurchase decisions is jamie dimon at j.p. morgan i recommend that you read his annual letter. charlie and i have mixed emotions when berkshire shares sell well below intrinsic value. we like making money for continuing shareholders and there is no surer way to do that than by buying an asset  our own stock  that we know to be worth at least x for less than that  for .#x .#x or even lower. as one of our directors says it's like shooting fish in a barrel after the barrel has been drained and the fish have quit flopping. nevertheless we don't enjoy cashing out partners at a discount even though our doing so may give the selling shareholders a slightly higher price than they would receive if our bid was absent. when we are buying therefore we want those exiting partners to be fully informed about the value of the assets they are selling. at our limit price of ###% of book value repurchases clearly increase berkshire's pershare intrinsic value. and the more and the cheaper we buy the greater the gain for continuing shareholders. therefore if given the opportunity we will likely repurchase stock aggressively at our price limit or lower. you should know however that we have no interest in supporting the stock and that our bids will fade in particularly weak markets. nor will we buy shares if our cashequivalent holdings are below ## billion. at berkshire financial strength that is unquestionable takes precedence over all else. this discussion of repurchases offers me the chance to address the irrational reaction of many investors to changes in stock prices. when berkshire buys stock in a company that is repurchasing shares we hope for two events first we have the normal hope that earnings of the business will increase at a good clip for a long time to come and second we also hope that the stock underperforms in the market for a long time as well. a corollary to this second point talking our book about a stock we own  were that to be effective  would actually be harmful to berkshire not helpful as commentators customarily assume. # let's use ibm as an example. as all business observers know ceos lou gerstner and sam palmisano did a superb job in moving ibm from nearbankruptcy twenty years ago to its prominence today. their operational accomplishments were truly extraordinary. but their financial management was equally brilliant particularly in recent years as the company's financial flexibility improved. indeed i can think of no major company that has had better financial management a skill that has materially increased the gains enjoyed by ibm shareholders. the company has used debt wisely made valueadding acquisitions almost exclusively for cash and aggressively repurchased its own stock. today ibm has #.## billion shares outstanding of which we own about ##.# million or #.#%. naturally what happens to the company's earnings over the next five years is of enormous importance to us. beyond that the company will likely spend ## billion or so in those years to repurchase shares. our quiz for the day what should a longterm shareholder such as berkshire cheer for during that period i won't keep you in suspense. we should wish for ibm's stock price to languish throughout the five years. let's do the math. if ibm's stock price averages say ### during the period the company will acquire ### million shares for its ## billion. there would consequently be ### million shares outstanding and we would own about #% of the company. if the stock conversely sells for an average of ### during the fiveyear period ibm will acquire only ### million shares. that would leave about ### million shares outstanding after five years of which we would own #.#%. if ibm were to earn say ## billion in the fifth year our share of those earnings would be a full ### million greater under the disappointing scenario of a lower stock price than they would have been at the higher price. at some later point our shares would be worth perhaps # vi billion more than if the highprice repurchase scenario had taken place. the logic is simple if you are going to be a net buyer of stocks in the future either directly with your own money or indirectly through your ownership of a company that is repurchasing shares you are hurt when stocks rise. you benefit when stocks swoon. emotions however too often complicate the matter most people including those who will be net buyers in the future take comfort in seeing stock prices advance. these shareholders resemble a commuter who rejoices after the price of gas increases simply because his tank contains a day's supply. charlie and i don't expect to win many of you over to our way of thinking  we've observed enough human behavior to know the futility of that  but we do want you to be aware of our personal calculus. and here a confession is in order in my early days i too rejoiced when the market rose. then i read chapter eight of ben graham's the intelligent investor the chapter dealing with how investors should view fluctuations in stock prices. immediately the scales fell from my eyes and low prices became my friend. picking up that book was one of the luckiest moments in my life. in the end the success of our ibm investment will be determined primarily by its future earnings. but an important secondary factor will be how many shares the company purchases with the substantial sums it is likely to devote to this activity. and if repurchases ever reduce the ibm shares outstanding to ##.# million i will abandon my famed frugality and give berkshire employees a paid holiday. now let's examine the four major sectors of our operations. each has vastly different balance sheet and income characteristics from the others. lumping them together therefore impedes analysis. so we'll present them as four separate businesses which is how charlie and i view them. because we may be repurchasing berkshire shares from some of you we will offer our thoughts in each section as to how intrinsic value compares to carrying value. # insurance let's look first at insurance berkshire's core operation and the engine that has propelled our expansion over the years. propertycasualty pc insurers receive premiums upfront and pay claims later. in extreme cases such as those arising from certain workers' compensation accidents payments can stretch over decades. this collectnow paylater model leaves us holding large sums  money we call float  that will eventually go to others. meanwhile we get to invest this float for berkshire's benefit. though individual policies and claims come and go the amount of float we hold remains remarkably stable in relation to premium volume. consequently as our business grows so does our float. and how we have grown as the following table shows year float  in  mil ####  ## #### ### #### #### #### ##### #### ##### #### ##### it's unlikely that our float will grow much  if at all  from its current level. that's mainly because we already have an outsized amount relative to our premium volume. were there to be a decline in float i will add it would almost certainly be very gradual and therefore impose no unusual demand for funds on us. if our premiums exceed the total of our expenses and eventual losses we register an underwriting profit that adds to the investment income our float produces. when such a profit occurs we enjoy the use of free money  and better yet get paid for holding it. unfortunately the wish of all insurers to achieve this happy result creates intense competition so vigorous in most years that it causes the pc industry as a whole to operate at a significant underwriting loss. for example. state farm by far the country ' s largest insurer and a wellmanaged company besides has incurred an underwriting loss in eight of the last eleven years. there are a lot of ways to lose money in insurance and the industry is resourceful in creating new ones. as noted in the first section of this report we have now operated at an underwriting profit for nine consecutive years our gain for the period having totaled ## billion. i believe it likely that we will continue to underwrite profitably in most  though certainly not all  future years. if we accomplish that our float will be better than costfree. we will profit just as we would if some party deposited ##.# billion with us paid us a fee for holding its money and then let us invest its funds for our own benefit. so how does this attractive float affect intrinsic value calculations our float is deducted in full as a liability in calculating berkshire's book value just as if we had to pay it out tomorrow and were unable to replenish it. but that's an incorrect way to view float which should instead be viewed as a revolving fund. if float is both costless and longenduring the true value of this liability is far lower than the accounting liability. partially offsetting this overstated liability is ##.# billion of goodwill attributable to our insurance companies that is included in book value as an asset. in effect this goodwill represents the price we paid for the floatgenerating capabilities of our insurance operations. the cost of the goodwill however has no bearing on its true value. if an insurance business produces large and sustained underwriting losses any goodwill asset attributable to it should be deemed valueless whatever its original cost. fortunately that's not the case at berkshire. charlie and i believe the true economic value of our insurance goodwill  what we would pay to purchase float of similar quality  to be far in excess of its historic carrying value. the value of our float is one reason  a huge reason  why we believe berkshire's intrinsic business value substantially exceeds book value. let me emphasize once again that costfree float is not an outcome to be expected for the pc industry as a whole we don't think there is much berkshirequality float existing in the insurance world. in most years including #### the industry's premiums have been inadequate to cover claims plus expenses. consequently the # industry's overall return on tangible equity has for many decades fallen far short of the average return realized by american industry a sorry performance almost certain to continue. berkshire's outstanding economics exist only because we have some terrific managers running some extraordinary insurance operations. let me tell you about the major units. first by float size is the berkshire hathaway reinsurance group run by ajit jain. ajit insures risks that no one else has the desire or the capital to take on. his operation combines capacity speed decisiveness and most importantly brains in a manner that is unique in the insurance business. yet he never exposes berkshire to risks that are inappropriate in relation to our resources. indeed we are far more conservative in that respect than most large insurers. for example if the insurance industry should experience a ### billion loss from some megacatastrophe  a loss about triple anything it has ever faced  berkshire as a whole would likely record a moderate profit for the year because of its many streams of earnings. concurrently all other major insurers and reinsurers would be far in the red and some would face insolvency. from a standing start in #### ajit has created an insurance business with float of ## billion and significant underwriting profits a feat that no ceo of any other insurer has come close to matching. by these accomplishments he has added a great many billions of dollars to the value of berkshire. charlie would gladly trade me for a second ajit. alas there is none. we have another insurance powerhouse in general re managed by tad montross. at bottom a sound insurance operation needs to adhere to four disciplines. it must # understand all exposures that might cause a policy to incur losses # conservatively evaluate the likelihood of any exposure actually causing a loss and the probable cost if it does # set a premium that will deliver a profit on average after both prospective loss costs and operating expenses are covered and # be willing to walk away if the appropriate premium can't be obtained. many insurers pass the first three tests and flunk the fourth. they simply can't turn their back on business that their competitors are eagerly writing. that old line the other guy is doing it so we must as well spells trouble in any business but in none more so than insurance. indeed a good underwriter needs an independent mindset akin to that of the senior citizen who received a call from his wife while driving home. albert be careful she warned i just heard on the radio that there's a car going the wrong way down the interstate. mabel they don't know the half of it replied albert it's not just one car there are hundreds of them. tad has observed all four of the insurance commandments and it shows in his results. general re's huge float has been better than costfree under his leadership and we expect that on average it will continue to be. in the first few years after we acquired it general re was a major headache. now it's a treasure. finally there is geico the insurer on which i cut my teeth ## years ago. geico is run by tony nicely who joined the company at ## and completed ## years of service in ####. geico' s muchenvied record comes from tony's brilliant execution of a superb and almost impossibletoreplicate business model. during tony's ##year tenure as ceo our market share has grown from #.#% to #.#%. if it had instead remained static  as it had for more than a decade before he took over  our premium volume would now be #.# billion rather than the ##.# billion we attained in ####. the extra value created by tony and his associates is a major element in berkshire's excess of intrinsic value over book value. there is still more than ##% of the autoinsurance market left for geico to rake in. don't bet against tony acquiring chunks of it year after year in the future. our low costs permit low prices and every day more americans discover that the gecko is doing them a favor when he urges them to visit geico.com for a quote. our lizard has another endearing quality unlike human spokesmen or spokeswomen who expensively represent other insurance companies our little fellow has no agent. in addition to our three major insurance operations we own a group of smaller companies most of them plying their trade in odd corners of the insurance world. in aggregate their results have consistently been profitable and the float they provide us is substantial. charlie and i treasure these companies and their managers. # at yearend we acquired princeton insurance a new jersey writer of medical malpractice policies. this bolton transaction expands the managerial domain of tim kenesey the star ceo of medical protective our indianabased medmal insurer. princeton brings with it more than ### million of float an amount that is included in the following table. here is the record of all four segments of our propertycasualty and life insurance businesses underwriting profit yearend float in millions insurance operations #### #### #### #### bh reinsurance ###  ### ##### ##### general re ### ### ##### ##### geico ### #### ##### ##### other primary ### ### #### ####  ### #### ##### ##### among large insurance operations berkshire's impresses me as the best in the world. regulated capitalintensive businesses we have two very large businesses bnsf and midamerican energy that have important common characteristics distinguishing them from our many other businesses. consequently we assign them their own sector in this letter and also split out their combined financial statistics in our gaap balance sheet and income statement. a key characteristic of both companies is the huge investment they have in very longlived regulated assets with these partially funded by large amounts of longterm debt that is not guaranteed by berkshire. our credit is not needed both businesses have earning power that even under terrible business conditions amply covers their interest requirements. in a less than robust economy during #### for example bnsf's interest coverage was #.#x. at midamerican meanwhile two key factors ensure its ability to service debt under all circumstances the stability of earnings that is inherent in our exclusively offering an essential service and a diversity of earnings streams which shield it from the actions of any single regulatory body. measured by tonmiles rail moves ##% of america's intercity freight and bnsf moves more than any other railroad  about ##% of the industry total. a little math will tell you that about ##% of all intercity tonmiles of freight in the u.s. is transported by bnsf. it is no exaggeration to characterize railroads as the circulatory system of our economy. your railroad is the largest artery. all of this places a huge responsibility on us. we must without fail maintain and improve our ##### miles of track along with ##### bridges ## tunnels #### locomotives and ##### freight cars. this job requires us to have ample financial resources under all economic scenarios and to have the human talent that can instantly and effectively deal with the vicissitudes of nature such as the widespread flooding bnsf labored under last summer. to fulfill its societal obligation bnsf regularly invests far more than its depreciation charge with the excess amounting to #.# billion in ####. the three other major u.s. railroads are making similar outlays. though many people decry our country's inadequate infrastructure spending that criticism cannot be levied against the railroad industry. it is pouring money  funds from the private sector  into the investment projects needed to provide better and more extensive service in the future. if railroads were not making these huge expenditures our country's publiclyfinanced highway system would face even greater congestion and maintenance problems than exist today. massive investments of the sort that bnsf is making would be foolish if it could not earn appropriate returns on the incremental sums it commits. but i am confident it will do so because of the value it delivers. many years ago ben franklin counseled keep thy shop and thy shop will keep thee. translating this to our regulated businesses he might today say take care of your customer and the regulator  your customer's representative  will take care of you. good behavior by each party begets good behavior in return. ## at midamerican we participate in a similar social compact. we are expected to put up everincreasing sums to satisfy the future needs of our customers. if we meanwhile operate reliably and efficiently we know that we will obtain a fair return on these investments. midamerican ##.#% owned by berkshire supplies #.# million customers in the u.s. with electricity operating as the largest supplier in iowa utah and wyoming and as an important provider in six other states as well. our pipelines transport #% of the country's natural gas. obviously many millions of americans depend on us every day. they haven't been disappointed. when midamerican purchased northern natural gas pipeline in #### that company's performance as a pipeline was rated dead last ## out of ## by the leading authority in the field. in the most recent report northern natural was ranked second. the top spot was held by our other pipeline kern river. in its electric business midamerican has a comparable record. in the most recent survey of customer satisfaction midamerican' s u.s. utilities ranked second among ## utility groups surveyed. the story was far different not many years back when midamerican acquired these properties. midamerican will have #### megawatts of wind generation in operation by the end of #### far more than any other regulated electric utility in the country. the total amount that we have invested or committed to wind is a staggering # billion. we can make this sort of investment because midamerican retains all of its earnings unlike other utilities that generally pay out most of what they earn. in addition late last year we took on two solar projects  one ###%owned in california and the other ##%owned in arizona  that will cost about # billion to construct. many more wind and solar projects will almost certainly follow. as you can tell by now i am proud of what has been accomplished for our society by matt rose at bnsf and by greg abel at midamerican. i am also both proud and grateful for what they have accomplished for berkshire shareholders. below are the relevant figures midamerican earnings in millions u.k. utilities k. . . t iowa utility f. . . . m .r western utilities pipelines  l homeservices m. . other net operating

enjoy terrific economics measured by earnings on unleveraged net tangible assets that run from ##% aftertax to more than ###%. others produce good returns in the area of ####%. a few however have very poor returns a result of some serious mistakes i made in my job of capital allocation. these errors came about because i misjudged either the competitive strength of the business being purchased or the future economics of the industry in which it operated. i try to look out ten or twenty years when making an acquisition but sometimes my eyesight has been poor. charlie's has been better he voted no more than present on several of my errant purchases. berkshire's newer shareholders may be puzzled over our decision to hold on to my mistakes. after all their earnings can never be consequential to berkshire's valuation and problem companies require more managerial time than winners. any management consultant or wall street advisor would look at our laggards and say dump them. that won't happen. for ## years we have regularly laid out berkshire's economic principles in these reports pages #### and number # # describes our general reluctance to sell poor performers which in most cases lag because of industry factors rather than managerial shortcomings. our approach is far from darwinian and many of you may disapprove of it. i can understand your position. however we have made  and continue to make  a commitment to the sellers of businesses we buy that we will retain those businesses through thick and thin. so far the dollar cost of that commitment has not been substantial and may well be offset by the goodwill it builds among prospective sellers looking for the right permanent home for their treasured business and loyal associates. these owners know that what they get with us can't be delivered by others and that our commitments will be good for many decades to come. ## please understand however that charlie and i are neither masochists nor polly annas. if either of the failings we set forth in rule # # is present  if the business will likely be a cash drain over the longer term or if labor strife is endemic  we will take prompt and decisive action. such a situation has happened only a couple of times in our ## year history and none of the businesses we now own is in straits requiring us to consider disposing of it. the steady and substantial comeback in the u.s. economy since mid#### is clear from the earnings shown at the front of this section. this compilation includes ## of our companies. but one of these marmon is itself the owner of ### operations in eleven distinct business sectors. in short when you look at berkshire you are looking across corporate america. so let's dig a little deeper to gain a greater insight into what has happened in the last few years. the four housingrelated companies in this section a group that excludes clayton which is carried under finance and financial products had aggregate pretax earnings of ### million in #### ### million in #### and ### million in ### #. if you subtract these earnings from those in the combined statement you will see that our multiple and diverse nonhousing operations earned #### million in #### #### million in #### and #### million in ### #. about ### million of the ### # earnings came from the lubrizol acquisition. the profile of the remaining #### earnings  #### million  illustrates the comeback of much of america from the devastation wrought by the #### financial panic. though housingrelated businesses remain in the emergency room most other businesses have left the hospital with their health fully restored. almost all of our managers delivered outstanding performances last year among them those managers who run housingrelated businesses and were therefore fighting hurricaneforce headwinds. here are a few examples  vic mancinelli again set a record at ctb our agricultural equipment operation. we purchased ctb in #### for ### million. it has subsequently distributed ### million to berkshire last year earned ### million pretax and has ### million in cash. vic has made a number of bolton acquisitions over the years including a meaningful one he signed up after yearend.  tti our electric components distributor increased its sales to a record #.# billion up ##.#% from ####. earnings also hit a record up ###% from #### the year in which we purchased the business. in #### tti performed far better than the large publiclytraded companies in its field. that's no surprise paul andrews and his associates have been besting them for years. charlie and i are delighted that paul negotiated a large bolton acquisition early in ####. we hope more follow.  iscar our ##%owned cuttingtools operation continues to amaze us. its sales growth and overall performance are unique in its industry. iscar' s managers  eitan wertheimer jacob harpaz and danny goldman  are brilliant strategists and operators. when the economic world was cratering in november #### they stepped up to buy tungaloy a leading japanese cuttingtool manufacturer. tungaloy suffered significant damage when the tsunami hit north of tokyo last spring. but you wouldn't know that now tungaloy went on to set a sales record in ####. i visited the iwaki plant in november and was inspired by the dedication and enthusiasm of tungaloy' s management as well as its staff. they are a wonderful group and deserve your admiration and thanks.  mclane our huge distribution company that is run by grady rosier added important new customers in #### and set a pretax earnings record of ### million. since its purchase in #### for #.# billion the company has had pretax earnings of #.# billion and also increased its lifo reserve by ### million because the prices of the retail products it distributes candy gum cigarettes etc. have risen. grady runs a logistical machine second to none. you can look for boltons at mclane particularly in our new wineandspirits distribution business. ## jordan hansell took over at netjets in april and delivered ### # pretax earnings of ### million. that is a particularly impressive performance because the sale of new planes was slow during most of the year. in december however there was an uptick that was more than seasonally normal. how permanent it will be is uncertain. a few years ago netjets was my number one worry its costs were far out of line with revenues and cash was hemorrhaging. without berkshire's support netjets would have gone broke. these problems are behind us and jordan is now delivering steady profits from a wellcontrolled and smoothlyrunning operation. netjets is proceeding on a plan to enter china with some firstclass partners a move that will widen our business moat. no other fractionalownership operator has remotely the size and breadth of the netjets operation and none ever will. ne jets' unrelenting focus on safety and service has paid off in the marketplace. it's a joy to watch marmon's progress under frank ptak's leadership. in addition to achieving internal growth frank regularly makes bolton acquisitions that in aggregate will materially increase marmon's earning power. he did three costing about ### million in the last few months. joint ventures around the world are another opportunity for marmon. at midyear marmon partnered with the kundalia family in an indian crane operation that is already delivering substantial profits. this is marmon's second venture with the family following a successful wire and cable partnership instituted a few years ago. of the eleven major sectors in which marmon operates ten delivered gains in earnings last year. you can be confident of higher earnings from marmon in the years ahead. buy commodities sell brands has long been a formula for business success. it has produced enormous and sustained profits for cocacola since #### and wrigley since ####. on a smaller scale we have enjoyed good fortune with this approach at see's candy since we purchased it ## years ago. last year see's had record pretax earnings of ## million bringing its total since we bought it to #.## billion. contrast that figure with our purchase price of ## million and our yearend carryingvalue net of cash of less than zero. yes you read that right capital employed at see's fluctuates seasonally hitting a low after christmas. credit brad kinstler for taking the company to new heights since he became ceo in ####. nebraska furniture mart ##% owned set an earnings record in ### # netting more than ten times what it did in #### when we acquired our stake. but that's not the big news. more important was nfm's acquisition of a ###acre tract north of dallas on which we will build what is almost certain to be the highestvolume homefurnishings store in the country. currently that title is shared by our two stores in omaha and kansas city each of which had recordsetting sales ol more than ### million in ####. it will be several years before the texas store is completed but i look forward to cutting the ribbon at the opening. at berkshire the managers do the work i take the bows. our new store which will offer an unequalled variety of merchandise sold at prices that can't be matched will bring huge crowds from near and far. this drawing power and our extensive holdings of land at the site should enable us to attract a number of other major stores. if any highvolume retailers are reading this contact me. our experience with nfm and the blumkin family that runs it has been a real joy. the business was built by rose blumkin known to all as mrs. b who started the company in #### with ### and a dream. she sold me our interest when she was ## and worked until she was ###. after retiring she died the next year a sequence i point out to any other berkshire manager who even thinks of retiring. mrs. b's son louie now ## helped his mother build the business after he returned from world war ii and along with his wife fran has been my friend for ## years. in turn louie's sons ron and irv have taken the company to new heights first opening the kansas city store and now gearing up for texas. ## the boys and i have had many great times together and i count them among my best friends. the blumkins are a remarkable family. never inclined to let an extraordinary gene pool go to waste i am rejoicing these days because several members of the fourth blumkin generation have joined nfm. overall the intrinsic value of the businesses in this berkshire sector significantly exceeds their book value. for many of the smaller companies however this is not true. i have made more than my share of mistakes buying small companies. charlie long ago told me if something's not worth doing at all it's not worth doing well and i should have listened harder. in any event our large purchases have generally worked well  extraordinarily well in a few cases  and overall this sector is a winner for us. certain shareholders have told me they hunger for more discussions of accounting arcana. so here's a bit of gaapmandated nonsense i hope both of them enjoy. common sense would tell you that our varied subsidiaries should be carried on our books at their cost plus the earnings they have retained since our purchase unless their economic value has materially decreased in which case an appropriate writedown must be taken. and that's essentially the reality at berkshire  except for the weird situation at marmon. we purchased ##% of the company in #### and put this interest on our books at our cost #.# billion. so far so good. then in early #### pursuant to our original contract with the pritzker family we purchased an additional ##% paying #.# billion as called for by a formula that reflected marmon's increased value. in this instance however we were required to immediately write off ### million of the purchase price retroactive to the end of ####. don't ask obviously this writeoff had no connection to economic reality. the excess of marmon's intrinsic value over its carrying value is widened by this meaningless writedown. finance and financial products this sector our smallest includes two rental companies xtra trailers and cort furniture and clayton homes the country's leading producer and financer of manufactured homes. aside from these ###%owned subsidiaries we also include in this category a collection of financial assets and our ##% interest in berkadia commercial mortgage. it's instructive to look at what transpired at our three operating businesses after the economy fell off a cliff in late #### because their experiences illuminate the fractured recovery that later came along. results at our two leasing companies mirrored the nonhousing economy. their combined pretax earnings were ## million in #### ## million in #### and ### million in #### an improvement reflecting the steady recovery we have seen in almost all of our nonhousing businesses. in contrast clayton's world of manufactured housing just like sitebuilt housing has endured a veritable depression experiencing no recovery to date. manufactured housing sales in the nation were ##### homes in #### ##### in #### and ##### in ####. when housing was booming in #### they were ######. despite these difficult times clayton has continued to operate profitably largely because its mortgage portfolio has performed well under trying circumstances. because we are the largest lender in the manufactured homes sector and are also normally lending to lowerandmiddleincome families you might expect us to suffer heavy losses during a housing meltdown. but by sticking to oldfashioned loan policies  meaningful down payments and monthly payments with a sensible relationship to regular income  clayton has kept losses to acceptable levels. it has done so even though many of our borrowers have had negative equity for some time. as is wellknown the u.s. went off the rails in its homeownership and mortgagelending policies and for these mistakes our economy is now paying a huge price. all of us participated in the destructive behavior  government lenders borrowers the media rating agencies you name it. at the core of the folly was the almost universal belief that the value of houses was certain to increase over time and that any dips would be inconsequential. the acceptance of this premise justified almost any price and practice in housing transactions. homeowners everywhere felt richer and rushed to monetize the increased value of their homes by refinancings. these massive cash infusions fueled a consumption binge throughout our economy. it all seemed great fun while it lasted. a largely unnoted fact large numbers of people who have lost their house through foreclosure have actually realized a profit because they carried out refinancings earlier that gave them cash in excess of their cost. in these cases the evicted homeowner was the winner and the victim was the lender. ## in #### the bubble burst just as all bubbles must. we are now in the fourth year of a cure that though long and painful is sure to succeed. today household formations are consistently exceeding housing starts. clayton's earnings should improve materially when the nation's excess housing inventory is worked off. as i see things today however i believe the intrinsic value of the three businesses in this sector does not differ materially from their book value. investments below we show our common stock investments that at yearend had a market value of more than # billion. ###### percentage of shares company company cost market owned in millions ######### american express company ##.#  ####  #### ######### the cocacola company #.# #### ##### ######## conocophillips #.# #### #### ######## international business machines corp #.# ##### ##### ######## johnson  johnson #.# #### #### ######## kraft foods inc #.# #### #### ######## munich re  ##.# #### #### ####### posco #.# ### #### ######## the procter  gamble

#### ##### others #### #### total common stocks carried at market .... ##### ##### this is our actual purchase price and also our tax basis gaap cost differs in a few cases because of writeups or writedowns that have been required. we made few changes in our investment holdings during ####. but three moves were important our purchases of ibm and bank of america and the # billion addition we made to our wells fargo position. the banking industry is back on its feet and wells fargo is prospering. its earnings are strong its assets solid and its capital at record levels. at bank of america some huge mistakes were made by prior management. brian moynihan has made excellent progress in cleaning these up though the completion of that process will take a number of years. concurrently he is nurturing a huge and attractive underlying business that will endure long after today's problems are forgotten. our warrants to buy ### million bank of america shares will likely be of great value before they expire. as was the case with cocacola in #### and the railroads in #### # was late to the ibm party. i have been reading the company's annual report for more than ## years but it wasn't until a saturday in march last year that my thinking crystallized. as thoreau said it's not what you look at that matters it's what you see. todd combs built a #.## billion portfolio at cost last year and ted weschler will soon create one of similar size. each of them receives ##% of his performance compensation from his own results and ##% from his partner's. when our quarterly filings report relatively small holdings these are not likely to be buys i made though the media often overlook that point but rather holdings denoting purchases by todd or ted. ## one additional point about these two new arrivals. both ted and todd will be helpful to the next ceo of berkshire in making acquisitions. they have excellent business minds that grasp the economic forces likely to determine the future of a wide variety of businesses. they are aided in their thinking by an understanding of what is predictable and what is unknowable. there is little new to report on our derivatives positions which we have described in detail in past reports. annual reports since #### are available at www.berkshirehathaway.com. one important industry change however must be noted though our existing contracts have very minor collateral requirements the rules have changed for new positions. consequently we will not be initiating any major derivatives positions. we shun contracts of any type that could require the instant posting of collateral. the possibility of some sudden and huge posting requirement  arising from an outoftheblue event such as a worldwide financial panic or massive terrorist attack  is inconsistent with our primary objectives of redundant liquidity and unquestioned financial strength. our insurancelike derivatives contracts whereby we pay if various issues included in highyield bond indices default are coming to a close. the contracts that most exposed us to losses have already expired and the remainder will terminate soon. in #### we paid out ## million on two losses bringing our total payments to #.# billion. we are almost certain to realize a final underwriting profit on this portfolio because the premiums we received were #.# billion and our future losses are apt to be minor. in addition we will have averaged about # billion of float over the fiveyear life of these contracts. this successful result during a time of great credit stress underscores the importance of obtaining a premium that is commensurate with the risk. charlie and i continue to believe that our equityput positions will produce a significant profit considering both the #.# billion of float we will have held for more than fifteen years and the ### million profit we've already realized on contracts that we repurchased. at yearend berkshire's book value reflected a liability of #.# billion for the remaining contracts if they had all come due at that time our payment would have been #.# billion. the basic choices for investors and the one we strongly prefer investing is often described as the process of laying out money now in the expectation of receiving more money in the future. at berkshire we take a more demanding approach defining investing as the transfer to others of purchasing power now with the reasoned expectation of receiving more purchasing power  after taxes have been paid on nominal gains  in the future. more succinctly investing is forgoing consumption now in order to have the ability to consume more at a later date. from our definition there flows an important corollary the riskiness of an investment is not measured by beta a wall street term encompassing volatility and often used in measuring risk but rather by the probability  the reasoned probability  of that investment causing its owner a loss of purchasingpower over his contemplated holding period. assets can fluctuate greatly in price and not be risky as long as they are reasonably certain to deliver increased purchasing power over their holding period. and as we will see a nonfluctuating asset can be laden with risk. investment possibilities are both many and varied. there are three major categories however and it's important to understand the characteristics of each. so let's survey the field.  investments that are denominated in a given currency include moneymarket funds bonds mortgages bank deposits and other instruments. most of these currencybased investments are thought of as safe. in truth they are among the most dangerous of assets. their beta may be zero but their risk is huge. over the past century these instruments have destroyed the purchasing power of investors in many countries even as the holders continued to receive timely payments of interest and principal. this ugly result moreover will forever recur. governments determine the ultimate value of money and systemic forces will sometimes cause them to gravitate to policies that produce inflation. from time to time such policies spin out of control. even in the u.s. where the wish for a stable currency is strong the dollar has fallen a staggering ##% in value since #### when i took over management of berkshire. it takes no less than # today to buy what # did at that time. consequently a taxfree institution would have needed #.#% interest annually from bond investments over that period to simply maintain its purchasing power. its managers would have been kidding themselves if they thought of any portion of that interest as income. ## for taxpaying investors like you and me the picture has been far worse. during the same ##year period continuous rolling of u.s. treasury bills produced #.#% annually. that sounds satisfactory. but if an individual investor paid personal income taxes at a rate averaging ##% this #.#% return would have yielded nothing in the way of real income. this investor's visible income tax would have stripped him of #.# points of the stated yield and the invisible inflation tax would have devoured the remaining #.# points. it's noteworthy that the implicit inflation tax was more than triple the explicit income tax that our investor probably thought of as his main burden. in god we trust may be imprinted on our currency but the hand that activates our government's printing press has been all too human. high interest rates of course can compensate purchasers for the inflation risk they face with currencybased investments  and indeed rates in the early ####s did that job nicely. current rates however do not come close to offsetting the purchasingpower risk that investors assume. right now bonds should come with a warning label. under today's conditions therefore i do not like currencybased investments. even so berkshire holds significant amounts of them primarily of the shortterm variety. at berkshire the need for ample liquidity occupies center stage and will never be slighted however inadequate rates may be. accommodating this need we primarily hold u.s. treasury bills the only investment that can be counted on for liquidity under the most chaotic of economic conditions. our working level for liquidity is ## billion ## billion is our absolute minimum. beyond the requirements that liquidity and regulators impose on us we will purchase currencyrelated securities only if they offer the possibility of unusual gain  either because a particular credit is mispriced as can occur in periodic junkbond debacles or because rates rise to a level that offers the possibility of realizing substantial capital gains on highgrade bonds when rates fall. though we've exploited both opportunities in the past  and may do so again  we are now # ## degrees removed from such prospects. today a wry comment that wall streeter shelby cullom davis made long ago seems apt bonds promoted as offering riskfree returns are now priced to deliver returnfree risk. the second major category of investments involves assets that will never produce anything but that are purchased in the buyer's hope that someone else  who also knows that the assets will be forever unproductive  will pay more for them in the future. tulips of all things briefly became a favorite of such buyers in the ## th century. this type of investment requires an expanding pool of buyers who in turn are enticed because they believe the buying pool will expand still further. owners are not inspired by what the asset itself can produce  it will remain lifeless forever  but rather by the belief that others will desire it even more avidly in the future. the major asset in this category is gold currently a huge favorite of investors who fear almost all other assets especially paper money of whose value as noted they are right to be fearful. gold however has two significant shortcomings being neither of much use nor procreative. true gold has some industrial and decorative utility but the demand for these purposes is both limited and incapable of soaking up new production. meanwhile if you own one ounce of gold for an eternity you will still own one ounce at its end. what motivates most gold purchasers is their belief that the ranks of the fearful will grow. during the past decade that belief has proved correct. beyond that the rising price has on its own generated additional buying enthusiasm attracting purchasers who see the rise as validating an investment thesis. as bandwagon investors join any party they create their own truth  for a while. over the past ## years both internet stocks and houses have demonstrated the extraordinary excesses that can be created by combining an initially sensible thesis with wellpublicized rising prices. in these bubbles an army of originally skeptical investors succumbed to the proof delivered by the market and the pool of buyers  for a time  expanded sufficiently to keep the bandwagon rolling. but bubbles blown large enough inevitably pop. and then the old proverb is confirmed once again what the wise man does in the beginning the fool does in the end. ## today the world's gold stock is about ###### metric tons. if all of this gold were melded together it would form a cube of about ## feet per side. picture it fitting comfortably within a baseball infield. at #### per ounce  gold's price as i write this  its value would be #.# trillion. call this cube pile a. let's now create a pile b costing an equal amount. for that we could buy all u.s. cropland ### million acres with output of about ### billion annually plus ## exxon mobils the world's most profitable company one earning more than ## billion annually. after these purchases we would have about # trillion left over for walkingaround money no sense feeling strapped after this buying binge. can you imagine an investor with #.# trillion selecting pile a over pile b beyond the staggering valuation given the existing stock of gold current prices make today's annual production of gold command about ### billion. buyers  whether jewelry and industrial users frightened individuals or speculators  must continually absorb this additional supply to merely maintain an equilibrium at present prices. a century from now the ### million acres of farmland will have produced staggering amounts of corn wheat cotton and other crops  and will continue to produce that valuable bounty whatever the currency may be. exxon mobil will probably have delivered trillions of dollars in dividends to its owners and will also hold assets worth many more trillions and remember you get ## exxons. the ###### tons of gold will be unchanged in size and still incapable of producing anything. you can fondle the cube but it will not respond. admittedly when people a century from now are fearful it's likely many will still rush to gold. i'm confident however that the #.# trillion current valuation of pile a will compound over the century at a rate far inferior to that achieved by pile b. our first two categories enjoy maximum popularity at peaks of fear terror over economic collapse drives individuals to currencybased assets most particularly u.s. obligations and fear of currency collapse fosters movement to sterile assets such as gold. we heard cash is king in late #### just when cash should have been deployed rather than held. similarly we heard cash is trash in the early ####s just when fixeddollar investments were at their most attractive level in memory. on those occasions investors who required a supportive crowd paid dearly for that comfort. my own preference  and you knew this was coming  is our third category investment in productive assets whether businesses farms or real estate. ideally these assets should have the ability in inflationary times to deliver output that will retain its purchasingpower value while requiring a minimum of new capital investment. farms real estate and many businesses such as cocacola ibm and our own see's candy meet that doublebarreled test. certain other companies  think of our regulated utilities for example  fail it because inflation places heavy capital requirements on them. to earn more their owners must invest more. even so these investments will remain superior to nonproductive or currencybased assets. whether the currency a century from now is based on gold seashells shark teeth or a piece of paper as today people will be willing to exchange a couple of minutes of their daily labor for a cocacola or some see's peanut brittle. in the future the u.s. population will move more goods consume more food and require more living space than it does now. people will forever exchange what they produce for what others produce. our country's businesses will continue to efficiently deliver goods and services wanted by our citizens. metaphorically these commercial cows will live for centuries and give ever greater quantities of milk to boot. their value will be determined not by the medium of exchange but rather by their capacity to deliver milk. proceeds from the sale of the milk will compound for the owners of the cows just as they did during the ## th century when the dow increased from ## to ## ### and paid loads of dividends as well. berkshire's goal will be to increase its ownership of firstclass businesses. our first choice will be to own them in their entirety  but we will also be owners by way of holding sizable amounts of marketable stocks. i believe that over any extended period of time this category of investing will prove to be the runaway winner among the three we've examined. more important it will be by far the safest. ## the annual meeting the annual meeting will be held on saturday may # th at the centurylink center renamed from qwest. last year carrie kizer debuted as the ringmaster and earned a lifetime assignment. everyone loved the job she did  especially me. soon after the # a.m. opening of the doors we will have a new activity the newspaper tossing challenge. late last year berkshire purchased the omaha worldherald and in my meeting with its shareholderemployees i told of the folding and throwing skills i developed while delivering ###### papers as a teenager. i immediately saw skepticism in the eyes of the audience. that was no surprise to me. after all the reporters' mantra is if your mother says she loves you check it out. so now i have to back up my claim. at the meeting i will take on all comers in making ##foot tosses of the worldherald to a clayton porch. any challenger whose paper lands closer to the doorstep than mine will receive a dilly bar. i've asked dairy queen to supply several for the contest though i doubt that any will be needed. we will have a large stack of papers. grab one. fold it no rubber bands. take your best shot. make my day. at ### a new berkshire movie will be shown. an hour later we will start the questionandanswer period which with a break for lunch at the centurylink' s stands will last until ###. after a short recess charlie and i will convene the annual meeting at ###. if you decide to leave during the day's question periods please do so while charlie is talking. the best reason to exit of course is to shop. we will help you do so by filling the ######squarefoot hall that adjoins the meeting area with products from dozens of berkshire subsidiaries. last year you did your part and most locations racked up record sales. in a ninehour period we sold #### pairs of justin boots ##### pounds of see's candy #### quikut knives that's ## knives per minute and #### pairs of wells lamont gloves a marmon product whose very existence was news to me. the product i focus on is money. but you can do better. remember anyone who says money can't buy happiness simply hasn't shopped at our meeting. among the new exhibitors this year will be brooks our runningshoe company. brooks has been gobbling up market share and in ### # had a sales gain of ##% its tenth consecutive year of record volume. drop by and congratulate jim weber the company's ceo. and be sure to buy a couple of pairs of limited edition berkshire hathaway running shoes. geico will have a booth staffed by a number of its top counselors from around the country all of them ready to supply you with auto insurance quotes. in most cases geico will be able to give you a shareholder discount usually #%. this special offer is permitted by ## of the ## jurisdictions in which we operate. one supplemental point the discount is not additive if you qualify for another such as that given certain groups. bring the details of your existing insurance and check out whether we can save you money. for at least half of you i believe we can. be sure to visit the bookworm. it will carry more than ## books and dvds including a couple of new ones. i recommend mitek an informative history of one of our very successful subsidiaries. you'll learn how my interest in the company was originally piqued by my receiving in the mail a hunk of ugly metal whose purpose i couldn't fathom. since we bought mitek in #### it has made ## tuckin acquisitions almost all successful. i think you'll also like a short book that peter bevelin has put together explaining berkshire's investment and operating principles. it sums up what charlie and i have been saying over the years in annual reports and at annual meetings. should you need to ship your book purchases a shipping service will be available nearby. if you are a big spender  or aspire to become one  visit elliott aviation on the east side of the omaha airport between noon and ### p.m. on saturday. there we will have a fleet of netjets aircraft that will get your pulse racing. come by bus leave by private jet. i'll ok your credit. an attachment to the proxy material that is enclosed with this report explains how you can obtain the credential you will need for admission to the meeting and other events. airlines have sometimes jacked up prices for the berkshire weekend. if you are coming from far away compare the cost of flying to kansas city versus omaha. the drive between the two cities is about # v% hours and it may be that you can save significant money particularly if you had planned to rent a car in omaha. spend the savings with us. ## at nebraska furniture mart located on a ##acre site on ## nd street between dodge and pacific we will again be having berkshire weekend discount pricing. last year the store did ##.# million of business during its annual meeting sale a volume that exceeds the yearly sales of most furniture stores. to obtain the berkshire discount you must make your purchases between tuesday may # st and monday may # th inclusive and also present your meeting credential. the period's special pricing will even apply to the products of several prestigious manufacturers that normally have ironclad rules against discounting but which in the spirit of our shareholder weekend have made an exception for you. we appreciate their cooperation. nfm is open from ## a.m. to # p.m. monday through saturday and ## a.m. to # p.m. on sunday. on saturday this year from # ## p.m. to # p.m. nfm is having a picnic to which you are all invited. at borsheims we will again have two shareholderonly events. the first will be a cocktail reception from # p.m. to # p.m. on friday may # th . the second the main gala will be held on sunday may # th  from # a.m. to # p.m. on saturday we will be open until # p.m. on sunday around # p.m. i will be clerking at borsheims desperate to beat my sales figure from last year. so come take advantage of me. ask me for my crazy warren price. we will have huge crowds at borsheims throughout the weekend. for your convenience therefore shareholder prices will be available from monday april ## th through saturday may ## th . during that period please identify yourself as a shareholder by presenting your meeting credentials or a brokerage statement that shows you are a berkshire holder. on sunday in the mall outside of borsheims a blindfolded patrick wolff twice u.s. chess champion will take on all comers  who will have their eyes wide open  in groups of six. nearby norman beck a remarkable magician from dallas will bewilder onlookers. additionally we will have bob hamman and sharon osberg two of the world's top bridge experts available to play bridge with our shareholders on sunday afternoon. two nonexperts  charlie and i  will also be at the tables. gorat's and piccolo's will again be open exclusively for berkshire shareholders on sunday may # th . both will be serving until ## p.m. with gorat's opening at # p.m. and piccolo's opening at # p.m. these restaurants are my favorites and i will eat at both of them on sunday evening. actuarial tables tell me that i can consume another ## million calories before my death. i'm terrified at the thought of leaving any of these behind so will be frontloading on sunday. remember to make a reservation at gorat's call ########## on april # st but not before and at piccolo's call ##########. at piccolo's show some class and order a giant root beer float for dessert. only sissies get the small one. we will again have the same three financial journalists lead the questionandanswer period at the meeting asking charlie and me questions that shareholders have submitted to them by email. the journalists and their email addresses are carol loomis of fortune who may be emailed at cloomisfortunemail.com becky quick of cnbc at berkshirequestionscnbc.com and andrew ross sorkin of the new york times at arsorkinnytimes.com. from the questions submitted each journalist will choose the dozen or so he or she decides are the most interesting and important. the journalists have told me your question has the best chance of being selected if you keep it concise avoid sending it in at the last moment make it berkshirerelated and include no more than two questions in any email you send them. in your email let the journalist know if you would like your name mentioned if your question is selected. this year we are adding a second panel of three financial analysts who follow berkshire. they are cliff gallant of kbw jay gelb of barclays capital and gary ransom of dowling and partners. these analysts will bring their own berkshire specific questions and alternate with the journalists and the audience. charlie and i believe that all shareholders should have access to new berkshire information simultaneously and should also have adequate time to analyze it which is why we try to issue financial information after the market close on a friday. we do not talk oneonone to large institutional investors or analysts. our new panel will let analysts ask questions  perhaps even a few technical ones  in a manner that may be helpful to many shareholders. ## neither charlie nor i will get so much as a clue about the questions to be asked. we know the journalists and analysts will come up with some tough ones and that's the way we like it. all told we expect at least ## questions which will allow for six from each analyst and journalist and ## from the audience. if there is some extra time we will take more from the audience. audience questioners will be determined by drawings that will take place at ### a.m. at each of the ## microphones located in the arena and main overflow room. for good reason i regularly extol the accomplishments of our operating managers. they are truly allstars who run their businesses as if they were the only asset owned by their families. i believe their mindset to be as shareholderoriented as can be found in the universe of large publiclyowned companies. most have no financial need to work the joy of hitting business home runs means as much to them as their paycheck. equally important however are the ## men and women who work with me at our corporate office all on one floor which is the way we intend to keep it. this group efficiently deals with a multitude of sec and other regulatory requirements and files a #####page federal income tax return  hello guinness  as well as state and foreign returns. additionally they respond to countless shareholder and media inquiries get out the annual report prepare for the country's largest annual meeting coordinate the board's activities  and the list goes on and on. they handle all of these business tasks cheerfully and with unbelievable efficiency making my life easy and pleasant. their efforts go beyond activities strictly related to berkshire they deal with ## universities selected from ### applicants who will send students to omaha this school year for a day with me and also handle all kinds of requests that i receive arrange my travel and even get me hamburgers for lunch. no ceo has it better. this home office crew along with our operating managers has my deepest thanks and deserves yours as well. come to omaha  the cradle of capitalism  on may # th and tell them so. february ## #### warren e. buffett chairman of the board # ##\""
